# Stock Inspection

**Stock Inspection** in ERPZ is a critical process that ensures the quality of both incoming and outgoing inventory items. This functionality is essential for maintaining the integrity of your products and meeting regulatory standards.

## Quality Inspection Process

When items are received into stock, quality inspectors have the ability to perform inspections based on predefined criteria, which may include:

- **Physical Condition**: Assessing the visible state of the items.
- **Specifications**: Verifying that items meet specific technical or design standards.
- **Regulatory Standards**: Ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The inspection results can be documented within the system, allowing for the following actions based on the outcome of the inspection:

- **Accepted**: Items that meet the required quality standards are approved for inventory.
- **Rejected**: Items that do not meet the standards are marked for return or disposal.
- **Placed on Hold**: Items requiring further evaluation are temporarily held until a final decision can be made.

## Outgoing Quality Inspections

In addition to incoming stock inspections, ERPZ also supports quality inspections during outgoing transactions, such as sales or transfers. This step is crucial to ensure that only items that meet specified quality standards are shipped or transferred to customers or other locations.

## Features in ERPZ

ERPZ facilitates several features to streamline the quality control process:

- **Inspection Criteria**: Customizable criteria that define what quality checks should be performed.
- **Inspection Plans**: Comprehensive plans that outline the steps and standards for quality inspections.
- **Inspection Certificates**: Documentation generated to certify that items have passed the quality inspection process.

These features work together to enhance the efficiency of the stock inspection process, helping businesses maintain high-quality inventory standards.

## Quality Inspection Template

In ERPZ, you can create a **Quality Inspection Template** to standardize the inspection process for various products or categories. This template allows you to define specific parameters and criteria to ensure consistency across all inspections.

## Conclusion

Implementing a robust stock inspection process is essential for maintaining product quality and compliance in ERPZ. By utilizing the quality inspection features available, businesses can significantly reduce the risk of quality-related issues and improve customer satisfaction.
