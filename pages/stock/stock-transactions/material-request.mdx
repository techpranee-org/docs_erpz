# Material Request

A **Material Request** in ERPZ is a document used to identify a requirement for a set of items (products or services) for a particular reason. It helps streamline procurement, production, and inventory planning processes.

A Material Request can serve the following purposes:

- **Purchase:** If the material being requested is to be purchased.
- **Material Transfer:** If the material is to be shifted from one warehouse to another.
- **Material Issue:** If the material is required for internal use, such as manufacturing or repair.
- **Manufacture:** If the material is required for production purposes.
- **Customer Provided:** If the material is provided by a customer for specific processes. To learn more, visit the Customer Provided Item section.

### 1.1 Alternate Ways of Creating a Material Request

ERPZ allows automatic creation of Material Requests through various triggers:

- **From a Sales Order:** A Material Request can be generated from a sales order. The user can choose to include or ignore the **Projected Quantity** of the item.
- **Based on Stock Levels:** When the projected quantity of an item reaches a specific level, a Material Request can be auto-generated to replenish stock.
- **From a Production Plan:** Automatically generate Material Requests based on production needs and plans.

For inventory items, it's important to specify the **Warehouse** where items are expected to be delivered to keep track of stock projections.

> **Note:** Material Requests are not mandatory but are helpful for centralized purchasing and tracking material requirements across departments.

A Material Request can have the following statuses:

- **Draft:** The request is saved but not yet submitted.
- **Submitted:** The document is officially submitted into the system.
- **Stopped:** If no further materials are required, the request can be stopped.
- **Canceled:** The request is no longer needed and has been canceled.
- **Pending:** Purchase or manufacture is pending to fulfill the material request.

## 2. Features of Material Request

### 2.1 Items Table

The **Items Table** in the Material Request allows for detailed tracking of requested materials:

- **Barcode Tracking:** Items can be tracked using barcodes.
- Item details such as code, name, description, image, and manufacturer are fetched from the item master.
- **Scan Barcode:** Add items by scanning their barcodes using a barcode scanner.
- Units of Measure (UoM), conversion factors, and amounts are automatically fetched.
- Warehouse and accounting details (such as expense account and dimensions) can be set for each item.

### 2.2 Setting Warehouses

Optionally, set the warehouse where the requested items will be delivered. This will be reflected in the **For Warehouse** field in the items table.

### 2.3 More Information

Fields like **Job Card** and **Work Order** allow you to reference the original document or transaction that generated the Material Request.

### 2.4 Printing Details

- **Letterhead:** Material Requests can be printed on your company letterhead.
- **Print Headings:** Customize print headings by selecting from predefined options or creating new ones via:
> Home > Settings > Printing > Print Heading


### 2.5 Terms and Conditions

Apply **Terms and Conditions** to the Material Request, especially in sales/purchase transactions where specific agreements govern the provision of goods or services. These terms will appear when printing the document.

### 2.6 After Submitting

Once a Material Request is submitted, you can create the following documents:

- **Request for Quotation**
- **Purchase Order**
- **Supplier Quotation**

### 2.7 Automatically Generate Material Requests

ERPZ supports the automatic generation of Material Requests based on inventory levels. You can enable this in the **Stock Settings** and set reorder levels for items. When stock dips below a certain level, a Material Request is automatically generated to replenish stock.
