# Stock Transactions

Stock transactions in ERPZ encompass a wide range of activities related to managing inventory movements within an organization. These transactions include stock transfers between warehouses, stock adjustments to correct inventory discrepancies, stock reconciliation to ensure accurate stock levels, and stock entries for recording stock movements such as purchases, sales, production, and consumption.

These transactions are essential for maintaining accurate stock levels, tracking stock movements, analyzing inventory performance, and making informed decisions related to procurement, sales, and production planning.

## 1. Key Stock Transactions

### 1.1 Material Request
A **Material Request** is created when stock is required for production, sales, or internal purposes. This helps in planning stock movements and procurement. The material request can be auto-generated based on reorder levels.

- Navigate to:
> Stock > Material Request > New


### 1.2 Auto Creation of Material Request
Material Requests can be automatically created based on reorder levels or production needs. Auto-creation helps streamline stock management by ensuring timely requests for necessary materials.

- Set up automatic requests in:
> Stock > Setup > Auto Material Request


### 1.3 Opening Stock
To add **Opening Stock** for newly created items or when starting to use ERPZ, an **Opening Stock Entry** must be made. This is essential for proper tracking of initial inventory.

- Navigate to:
> Stock > Stock Entry > New


### 1.4 Stock Entry
A **Stock Entry** is used to record stock movements, whether it's incoming, outgoing, or transfers between warehouses. This transaction type covers scenarios such as purchases, sales, production, and consumption.

- Stock entries can be categorized into:
- **Material Receipt:** For incoming goods.
- **Material Issue:** For outgoing goods.
- **Material Transfer:** For moving goods between warehouses.
- **Manufacture Entry:** For recording production.

### 1.5 Accounting of Inventory Stock
ERPZ automatically handles the accounting of inventory stock, linking all stock transactions to financial entries. Stock valuation methods (FIFO, Moving Average) are supported, and appropriate entries are posted in the General Ledger.

### 2.5 Delivery Trip
The **Delivery Trip** records multiple deliveries planned on a single trip, ensuring tracking and optimization of delivery routes.

The **Packing Slip** details the contents of a shipment and is linked to the delivery note for a customer order.
