# Pick List

A **Pick List** is a document that indicates which items should be taken from your inventory to fulfill orders.

This is particularly useful for businesses with a large amount of inventory, a high volume of orders, or customers ordering many Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). The Pick List selects the Warehouse where an Item is available on a **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** basis. For batched items, the Warehouse with the batch nearest to its expiry will be selected.

To access Pick List, go to:

`Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Pick List`

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and using a Pick List, ensure the following are created:

- **Stock Item**
- **Warehouse**

## 2. How to create Pick List

1. Go to the Pick List list and click on **New**.
2. Set the **Company**.
3. Select the **Purpose** of the Pick List. These are the options:
   - **Delivery**: Add items from a Sales Order for delivery. After submitting the Pick List, you can create a Delivery Note based on the Warehouse from which items were picked.
   - **Material Transfer for Manufacture**: Select a Work Order to pick raw materials for manufacturing. After picking, create a Stock Entry for the raw materials.
   - **Material Transfer**: Select a Material Request to pick items for. After picking, create a Stock Entry for the picked items.

4. Add the items and quantities to be picked in the **Item Locations** table. Click on **Get Item Locations** to fetch the Warehouse and other details for each item.
   - **Parent Warehouse**: If selected, Warehouses under that parent Warehouse will be suggested.
   - **Get Item Locations**: Useful when adding items manually or changing quantities in the Item Locations table.

5. **Item Locations** will include details like the Warehouse, Serial Number (for serialized items), and Batch Number (for batched items).
   - If Serial Numbers are involved, the Item row will appear as follows:



6. Save and Submit the Pick List once the stock-picking process is complete.

Ensure that the **Item Locations Table** displays the selected Warehouse for each item. Once stock-picking is complete, submit the document.

> **Note:**

### 2.2 Create Pick List from a Work Order

The **Item Locations** table will display the selected Warehouse for each raw material. Once the picking process is complete, submit the document.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Update Current Stock

If a Pick List is outdated and stock availability changes, click **Update Current Stock** to refresh the quantities and Warehouses in the **Item Locations** table.

> **Note:** This button is visible only if no Delivery Notes or Stock Entries have been created against the Pick List.

### 3.2 Barcode Scanning

The Pick List supports barcode scanning with two features: **Scan Mode** and **Prompt Qty**.

- **Scan Mode**: Users can scan barcodes to confirm the correct items are being picked.
- **Prompt Qty**: When enabled, a dialog prompts the user to enter the quantity to be incremented.

## 4. Pick Manually

When manually selecting batches, the system may override changes upon saving. To prevent this, enable the **Pick Manually** checkbox. This will preserve manual changes made to the Pick List.
