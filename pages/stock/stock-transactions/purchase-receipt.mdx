# Purchase Receipt

**Purchase Receipts are made when you accept Items from your Supplier usually against a Purchase Order.**

You can also accept Purchase Receipts directly without the need for a Purchase Order. To do this, set *Purchase Order Required* as “No” in Buying Settings.

### Accessing Purchase Receipt List
Go to:

`Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Purchase Receipt`

## Purchase Receipt Flow

### 1. Prerequisites
Before creating and using a Purchase Receipt, it is advised that you create the following first:

- [Purchase Order]()

> **Note**: From version-13 onwards, we have introduced immutable ledger which changes the rules for cancellation of stock entries and posting backdated stock transactions. Learn more [here](/path-to-immutable-ledger).

### 2. How to create a Purchase Receipt
A Purchase Receipt is usually created from a Purchase Order. In the Purchase Order, click on **Create > Purchase Receipt**.

To create a Purchase Receipt manually (not recommended), follow these steps:

1. Go to the Purchase Receipt list and click on **New**.
2. The Supplier name and the Items can be fetched from the Purchase Order by clicking on *Get Items from > Purchase Order*.
3. Set the *Accepted Warehouse* for all items in this Purchase Receipt.
4. In case any Items are defective, set the *Rejected Warehouse* where those Items will be stored.
5. Select the Item and enter the quantity in the Items table.
6. The rate will be fetched and the amount will be calculated automatically.
7. You can expand the item row to change the Accepted Warehouse for an Item.
8. Save and submit.

#### 2.1 Statuses

The different statuses a Purchase Receipt can be in:

- **Draft**: A draft is saved but yet to be submitted to the system.
- **To Bill**: Yet to be billed using a Purchase Invoice.
- **Completed**: Submitted and received all the Items.
- **Return Issued**: All the Items have been returned.
- **Cancelled**: Cancelled the Purchase Receipt.
- **Closed**: Closing the Purchase Receipt at a different quantity than ordered.
