# Stock Reconciliation

**Stock Reconciliation** is the process of counting and evaluating materials/products periodically at the year-end. 

This is done in order to:

- Keep the actual physical stock count and book stock count in sync.
- Value the stock for preparation of the accounting statements.

The Stock Reconciliation feature in ERPZ is used for:

- Posting opening stock.
- Reconciling book and actual stock.

To access the Stock Reconciliation list, go to:  
**Home > Stock > Tools > Stock Reconciliation**

## 1. How to Create a Stock Reconciliation to Post Opening Stock

Using stock reconciliation, you can update the number of specific items in a warehouse as of a specific time. You can also add items in the stock which have Serial Numbers or Batch Numbers.

1. Go to the Stock Reconciliation list and click on **New**.
2. Select the Purpose as **Opening Stock**. You can edit the posting Date and Time.
3. Select **Item Code**, **Warehouse**, **Quantity**, and **Valuation Rate**. If there is a Serial/Batch No involved, add it.
4. If you want to auto-generate Serial No/Batch No, keep those fields blank.
   - For auto-generation of Serial No, you need to set "Serial Number Series" in the Item master.
   - For auto-generation of Batch No, enable the "Automatically Create New Batch" checkbox in the item master.
5. The Difference Account will be set as **Temporary Opening**.
6. Save and Submit.

> **Note:** Maintain Stock option should be enabled in Item master for this to work.

## 2. How to Create a Stock Reconciliation to Reconcile Book and Physical Stock Count

Stock Reconciliation is the process of counting and evaluating stock-in-trade, periodically and at year-end, in order to value the total stock for preparing accounting statements. In this process, the actual physical stocks are checked and recorded in the system. The actual stocks and the stock in the system should be in agreement and accurate. If they are not, you can use the Stock Reconciliation tool to reconcile stock balance and value with actuals.

To reconcile the stock:

1. Go to the Stock Reconciliation list and click on **New**.
2. Select the Purpose as **Stock Reconciliation**. You can edit the posting Date and Time.
3. Set **Item Code**, **Warehouse**.
4. The current Quantity and Valuation Rate will be fetched; change the quantity as required.
5. The expense account in Difference Account will be set to **Stock Adjustment** by default.
6. The Cost Center default will be **Main**; change if needed.
7. Save and Submit.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Upload Data Through Spreadsheet

If you have a lot of items, you can upload the details via a spreadsheet.

1. Download Template  
   Open a new Stock Reconciliation and click on the **Download** button to download the template in CSV format.
  
2. Enter Data in CSV Template  
   The CSV format is case-sensitive. Do not edit the headers that are pre-set in the template. In the Item Code and Warehouse column, enter the exact Item Code and Warehouse as created in your ERPZ account. For quantity, enter the stock level you wish to set for that item in a specific warehouse.
  
3. Upload the CSV file with the data by clicking on the **Upload** button.
  
4. Review, Save, and Submit.

5. Check the Stock Ledger Report for updated stock balance.

### 3.2 Get Stock Balance and Valuation as of Specific Date and Time

You can import the stock balance and valuation as of a specific date and time from a selected Warehouse by clicking on the **Items** button. You can update the Quantity and Valuation Rate as needed.

### 3.3 Using Barcode Scanner to Scan Physical Inventory

If you have configured barcodes for your items, you can use a barcode scanner to reconcile physical quantities. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Set default warehouse.
2. Enable **Scan Mode**; this will disable fetching existing quantities and let you add quantities by incrementally scanning items.
3. Click on the **Scan Barcode** field and use your barcode scanner to send input. The reconciliation items table will keep getting updated as you scan items. 

## 4. How Stock Reconciliation Works

Once a stock reconciliation is posted to update the quantity on a specific date and time for an item in a warehouse, it will not be modified by subsequent stock transactions, even if such transactions have a posting date that is prior to the stock reconciliation date. In other words, backdated entries will not change the stock numbers after a Stock Reconciliation entry is posted.

### 4.1 For Non-Serialized Items

Consider an item with code **ABC001** in a **Mumbai** warehouse. Let's assume that stock as of 10th January is 100 units. Stock Reconciliation is made on 12th January to set stock balance to 150 units.

| Posting Date | Qty | Balance Qty | Voucher Type          |
|--------------|-----|-------------|-----------------------|
| 10/01/2014   | 100 | 100         | Purchase Receipt      |
| 12/01/2014   | 150 | 150         | Stock Reconciliation   |

If a new Purchase Receipt entry is made on 5th January 2014, which is prior to the date of Stock Reconciliation entry, the Stock Ledger would look as follows:

| Posting Date | Qty | Balance Qty | Voucher Type          |
|--------------|-----|-------------|-----------------------|
| 05/01/2014   | 20  | 20          | Purchase Receipt      |
| 10/01/2014   | 100 | 120         | Purchase Receipt      |
| 12/01/2014   | 150 | 150         | Stock Reconciliation   |

As you can see, the Balance Qty as of 10th January got updated from 100 to 120. However, the Balance Qty as of 12th January did not get updated from 150 to 170.

### 4.2 For Serialized Items

For an item **ITEM-00225** that has the serial numbers **HJF00020**, **HJF00021**, **HJF00022**, **HJF00023**, **HJF00024**, **HJF00025** with a valuation rate of 530 per serial number. At the end of the year, the user has come to know that they have only 3 serial numbers against that item with Valuation Rate 620. 

To adjust the stock value in accounting, the system will credit the extra amount **(3,180 - 1,860 = 1,320)** to the Warehouse's account and debit to the stock adjustment account. The GL entries for the above entry can be viewed by clicking on the button **View > Accounting Ledger**.

### 4.3 For Batch Items

Stock reconciliation for batch items will be used to add a new batch or to update the quantity of the existing batch. For example, if batch **JHGJH00003** has a current quantity of 60 but if the user wants to make it 100, then by using stock reconciliation, the user can update the batch quantity.

## 5. Serial and Batch Bundle

In version 15, the serial and batch bundle feature has been introduced to make stock transactions against the serial number/batch items. For stock reconciliation, the user gets two options to make a serial and batch bundle:

### 5.1 Use Serial / Batch Fields

The user can use the old serial/batch fields to make serial and batch bundles automatically. In this case, the user has to enable the checkbox **"Use Serial No / Batch Fields"** in the line item.

### 5.2 Use Serial / Batch Bundle

The user can use the Serial / Batch bundle to make stock reconciliation for serialized/batched items. Here, the user gets the option to either:

- **Reconcile Selected Serial Nos / Batches:** Disable the **"Reconcile All Serial Nos / Batches"** checkbox and create a serial and batch bundle for specific serial numbers or batches.

- **Reconcile All Serial Nos / Batches:** Enable the checkbox **"Reconcile All Serial Nos / Batches"** to reconcile and keep only one batch.
