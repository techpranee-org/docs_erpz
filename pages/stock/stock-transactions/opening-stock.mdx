# Opening Stock

**Opening Stock** refers to the quantity and value of materials available for sale or use at the beginning of an accounting period. It serves as a starting point for inventory management in a new period. The **Closing Stock** of the previous accounting period automatically becomes the Opening Stock for the current accounting period.
