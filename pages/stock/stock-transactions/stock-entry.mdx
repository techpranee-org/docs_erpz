# Stock Entry

A **Stock Entry** in ERPZ allows you to record the movement of items between warehouses. It helps in tracking stock transfers, material issues, receipts, and manufacturing processes.

## How to Access Stock Entry

To access the Stock Entry list, navigate to:

> Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Stock Entry

## Stock Entry Purposes

Stock entries in ERPZ can be created for several purposes:

- **Material Issue**: When materials are issued out of the company or for internal use (outgoing material). The items are deducted from the Source Warehouse.
- **Material Receipt**: When materials are received into the warehouse (incoming material). The items are added to the Target Warehouse.
- **Material Transfer**: When materials are moved between internal warehouses.
- **Material Transfer for Manufacturing**: Raw materials are transferred for manufacturing, typically against a Work Order or Job Card.
- **Material Consumption for Manufacture**: Multiple consumption stock entries can be created against a manufacturing Work Order.
- **Manufacture**: When finished goods are received from a manufacturing operation.
- **Repack**: When materials are repacked into new items.
- **Send to Subcontractor**: When materials are issued for a subcontracting activity, linked to a Purchase Order.

For more details about each stock entry purpose, refer to the [Stock Entry Purposes](./stock-entry-purpose.mdx) page.
