# Stock Ledger Report

**A Stock Ledger Report is a detailed record that keeps track of stock movements for a company.** It provides comprehensive insights into the inward and outward transactions related to manufacturing, purchasing, selling, and stock transfers.

This report reflects the quantity and value of stock **issued, received, or transferred**, along with the details of the stock item and its warehouse. It is particularly useful when the **Perpetual Inventory** system is enabled, as it provides a complete history of all stock transactions, presenting a more granular view of stock movements.

## 1. Stock Ledger Report Attributes

- **Incoming Rate**: This reflects the actual value of the stock when it was added to your inventory. It corresponds to the value entered in the *Rate* field of the relevant document.

- **Balance Value**: This represents the total value of the remaining stock in inventory. It is calculated as the product of the Valuation Rate and the Balance Quantity of a stock item.

- **Valuation Rate**: This is determined based on the selected valuation method for the item.
