# Installation Note in ERPZ

An **Installation Note** is used to record the installation or setup of a product at the customer's location. For example, if you sell an Air Conditioner, a service technician typically accompanies the delivery to install it at the customer's site. The technician can then create an Installation Note to track the installation date and other details.

To access the **Installation Note** list in ERPZ, navigate to:

`Home > Stock > Serial No and Batch > Installation Note`

## 1. How to Create an Installation Note

An **Installation Note** is usually created from a **Delivery Note**. However, you can also create it manually and use the **From Delivery Note** button to fetch details from an existing Delivery Note.

### Steps to Create an Installation Note:

1. Go to the **Installation Note** list and click **New**.
2. If creating from a Delivery Note:
   - Select the Delivery Note to fetch the customer, item, and quantity details automatically.
3. The date and time will be set based on when the Installation Note is created.
4. Add any additional remarks about the installation, if necessary.
5. If the item is serialized, ensure to add the relevant serial numbers in the **Items** table.
6. Save and submit the Installation Note.
