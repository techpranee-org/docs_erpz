## 1. Shipping Rule

Shipping Rules allow businesses to define various parameters for calculating shipping charges based on factors such as weight, volume, destination, or shipping method. These rules help automate the calculation of shipping costs during sales transactions, ensuring accurate and consistent charges based on predefined criteria.

### 1.1 How to Create a Shipping Rule

1. Navigate to:

> Stock > Setup > Shipping Rule > New

2. **Enter Rule Name:** Add a name for the Shipping Rule.
3. **Select Conditions:**
- **Based on Weight/Volume:** Set shipping rates based on weight or volume of the items.
- **Destination:** Set different rates for domestic or international shipments.
- **Shipping Method:** Define charges based on the selected shipping method (e.g., air, sea, ground).
4. **Enter Shipping Rates:** Define the shipping charges based on the criteria set above.
5. **Enable:** Ensure the rule is enabled to apply in transactions.

Once the Shipping Rule is created, it will automatically apply during sales transactions whenever the conditions are met, ensuring consistent and accurate shipping costs.
