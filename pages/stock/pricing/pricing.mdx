# Pricing

In the stock module of ERPZ, item pricing is essential for managing the cost and selling price of items. Each item in the system can have a defined purchase price, reflecting the cost incurred to acquire it. ERPZ allows businesses to set different pricing levels based on various factors, such as currency, customer groups, or specific pricing rules.

This flexible pricing structure enables businesses to implement a wide range of pricing strategies, including volume discounts, promotional pricing, or tiered pricing based on customer relationships. With effective item pricing in ERPZ, businesses can maintain accurate cost calculations, optimize profit margins, and tailor pricing strategies to meet specific customer needs and market conditions.


- [**Price Lists**](/stock/pricing/price-lists): ERPZ allows businesses to create and manage multiple price lists, each serving a different purpose, such as retail, wholesale, or export pricing. These price lists help streamline operations by automatically applying the correct pricing based on the customer type, currency, or region.


- [**Item Price**](/stock/pricing/item-price): The **Item Price** feature in ERPZ enables the setup of purchase and selling prices for each item. Businesses can also define item prices in different currencies, helping manage global operations efficiently. This feature supports multi-tiered pricing strategies and ensures consistent, accurate pricing across sales and purchasing processes.
