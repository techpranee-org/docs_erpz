# Item

An Item is a product or a service offered by your company.

The term Item is also applicable to raw materials or components of products yet to be produced (before they can be sold to customers). ERPZ allows you to manage all sorts of items like raw-materials, sub-assemblies, finished goods, item variants, and service items.

ERPZ is optimized for itemized management of your sales and purchase. If you are in services, you can create an Item for each service that you offer. Completing the Item Master is very essential for the successful implementation of ERPZ.

To access the Item list, go to: 
> **Home > Stock > Items and Pricing > Item**

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and using an Item, it is advised that you create the following first:

- [Item Group](/stock/stock-masters/item-group)
- [Warehouse]()
- [Unit of Measure]()

## 2. How to create an Item

1. Go to the Item list, click on "New".
2. Enter an Item Code. The name will be auto-filled the same as Item Code on clicking inside the Item Name field.
3. Select an Item Group.
4. Enter the opening stock units and standard selling rate.
5. Click **Save**.

### 2.1 Item Properties

- **Item Name**: Actual name of your product or service.

- **Item Group**: Category to which the Item belongs (e.g., products, raw materials, services). Pre-select your default groups under **Setup > Item Group**.
- **Default Unit of Measure (UOM)**: The measuring unit for the product (Nos, Kgs, Meters, etc.). Learn more on the [Unit of Measure page]().

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Brand and Description

### 3.2 Barcodes

You can associate barcodes with items for quick transactions. ERPNext supports the following types of barcodes:

### 3.3 Inventory

- **Shelf Life in Days**: Number of days after which the item batch will be unusable.
- **End of Life**: The date when the item will become unusable.

### 3.4 Automatic Reordering

Automatic reordering can be set up based on stock levels. When stock dips below the set quantity, a Material Request is automatically created.

- **Re-order Level**: The minimum quantity that triggers reordering.
- **Re-order Qty**: The quantity to reorder when the stock dips below the reorder level.
  
### 3.5 Multiple Units of Measure

You can add alternate UOMs for an item. For example, if you sell in Nos but receive in Kilos, set an alternate UOM with a conversion factor.

### 3.6 Serial Numbers and Batches

You can track individual items with serial numbers or manage batches for tracking purposes. Negative stock is not allowed for serialized or batched items from version 15 onwards.

- **Has Batch No**: Enable this for batch management. Batch numbers can be generated automatically or manually.
