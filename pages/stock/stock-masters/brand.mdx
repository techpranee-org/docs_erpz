# Brand

A **Brand** identifies items with a specific name.

Typically, a Brand refers to the manufacturer or packer of a product. For example, **Apple** is a brand that manufactures laptops. However, a Brand is not necessarily the same as the Manufacturer; it is simply the name under which a product is sold. For instance, if you manufacture plastic cups, you may license them to a larger brand to be sold under their name.

In ERPZ, Brands can be assigned to Items for identification and to apply specific defaults.

To access the Brand list, navigate to:
> **Home > Selling > Sales > Brand**

## 1. How to Create a Brand

1. Go to the **Brand** list and click **New**.
2. Enter a Brand name and add a description, if needed.
