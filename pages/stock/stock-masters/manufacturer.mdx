# Manufacturer

A **Manufacturer** is the entity that produces or creates an item. The Manufacturer may not necessarily be the entity that sells the item under a specific brand. For example, **Unico Plastics** can be the Manufacturer of plastic brushes, but these brushes might be sold under the brand **Super Brushes**.

In ERPZ, a Manufacturer can also be associated with specific part numbers for identifying items.

To access the **Manufacturer** list, go to:
> **Home > Stock > Manufacturer**
