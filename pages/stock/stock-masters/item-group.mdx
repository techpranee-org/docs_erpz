# Item Group

An **Item Group** is a way to classify items based on types.

Depending on the type of product, you can categorize an item under its respective field. For example:
- If the product is service-oriented, assign it under the Item Group - *Service*.
- If the product is used as a raw material, assign it under the *Raw Material* category.
- For items used only in trading, you can categorize them under an Item Group called *Trading*.

To access the Item Group list, navigate to: 
> **Home > Stock > Items and Pricing > Item Group**

This is what the Item Group tree looks like: **Item Group Tree**
