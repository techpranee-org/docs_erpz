# Product Bundle

A **Product Bundle** allows you to combine existing items that are sold together as a set. This is useful when you sell a main product and need to ensure that accompanying items, like accessories, are delivered along with it and have their stock levels updated accordingly.

For example, when selling a **smartphone**, you may want to bundle it with a **charger**, **cable**, and **sim ejector pin**. A **Product Bundle** will enable you to deliver these items together and keep track of their stock.

A **Product Bundle** can be viewed as the "Bill-of-Materials" (BOM) equivalent on the sales side.

To access the Product Bundle list, go to:
> **Home > Selling > Items and Pricing > Product Bundle**

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and using a Product Bundle, it is recommended to first create the following:

- **Item**: The main and child items need to be created in the Item list.

---

## 2. How to Create a Product Bundle

1. Navigate to the **Product Bundle** list and click on **Add Product Bundle**.
2. Select a **Parent Item**. If it's not created yet, you can create one. Ensure that "Maintain Stock" is unchecked when creating the Parent Item (e.g., **Dinner Set**).
3. Enter a price for the Parent Item. This price will be fetched during sales transactions.
4. Optionally, add a description for internal reference.
5. Add the products that will be bundled under the **Items** table, specifying their quantities.
6. Click **Save**.

### 2.1 Selecting Parent Item

In the **Product Bundle** master, there are two key sections: **Parent Item** and the list of **Child Items**.

- **Parent Item**: The Parent Item serves as a virtual container and should not be a physical product. To ensure this, uncheck the **Maintain Stock** option in the Item Form. Stock is maintained only for the Child Items.
  
If you want to maintain stock for the Parent Item, consider creating a regular **Bill of Material (BOM)** and handle packaging through Stock Entry Transactions.

---

### 2.2 Selecting Child Items

In the **Items** table, you need to list all the Child Items for which stock is maintained. These are the items that will be delivered to the customer. 

**Note**: The Parent Item is virtual, meaning it should also be included in the Child Items list (e.g., the **smartphone** in our earlier example).

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Product Bundle in Sales Transactions

When performing a sales transaction (e.g., Sales Invoice, Sales Order, Delivery Note), the **Parent Item** will be selected in the main item table.

Upon selecting a Parent Item in the main item table, the associated Child Items will automatically appear in the **Packing List** table of the transaction. If any Child Item is serialized, you can specify its **Serial Number** directly in the Packing List.

Once the transaction is submitted, stock levels for the Child Items will be reduced based on the warehouse specified in the Packing List.

---

### 3.2 Using Product Bundle for Offers/Schemes

Product Bundles can also be used to manage promotional offers such as **"Buy One Get One Free"**.

For example, a customer in the nutrition industry wanted a feature to handle such promotions. They created a **non-stock Parent Item** for the offer. In the item's description, they included the details of the offer and an image. In the **Package Items**, they set the quantity of the sellable product to two. This way, whenever the Parent Item was sold, two quantities of the product were deducted from the warehouse.
