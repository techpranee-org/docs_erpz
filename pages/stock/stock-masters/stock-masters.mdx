# Stock Masters in ERPZ

In ERPZ, the masters play a crucial role in managing stock-related data. 

These **DocTypes** act as templates for storing information about various aspects of stock management, such as items, warehouses, batches, and stock transactions. They provide a structured way to input, store, and retrieve data related to stock items, their attributes, and movements within the system.

Master DocTypes in the ERPZ Stock module enable businesses to maintain accurate inventory records, track stock movements, and make informed decisions regarding procurement, sales, and stock optimization.

- [**Item**](/stock/stock-masters/item): Represents individual products or materials managed in the stock module.
- [**Item Group**](/stock/stock-masters/item-group): Organizes items into categories for better stock management.
- [**Brand**](/stock/stock-masters/brand): Stores information about the brand or manufacturer of an item.
- [**Product Bundle**](/stock/stock-masters/product-bundle): Combines multiple items into a single product or service package.
- [**Item Alternative**](/stock/stock-masters/item-alternative): Stores alternative options for items that can be substituted.
- [**Manufacturer**](/stock/stock-masters/manufacturer): Stores information about the manufacturer of items.
- [**Item Variants**](/stock/stock-masters/item-variants): Manages different variations of an item, such as size or color.
- [**Item Attribute**](/stock/stock-masters/item-attribute): Defines the attributes or characteristics of an item, such as color, material, or size.

- [**Fractions in UOM**](/stock/stock-masters/fractions-uom): Allows fractional quantities for specific units of measure, enabling precision in stock transactions.

These stock masters are integral to ensuring that the ERPZ Stock module maintains up-to-date and accurate inventory data.
