# Managing Fractions in UoM

**UoM** stands for **Unit of Measurement**. Common examples of UoMs include:
- Numbers (Nos)
- Kilograms (Kg)
- Liters (L)
- Meters (m)
- Box
- Carton

Some UoMs cannot have values with decimal places. For instance, when dealing with items like televisions, where the UoM is defined as **Nos**, you cannot have quantities such as 1.5 Nos of televisions or 3.7 Nos of computer sets. The quantity for these items must always be a whole number.

## 1. Configuring UoM for Whole Numbers

You can configure whether a particular UoM can have decimal values or not. By default, ERPZ allows decimal values for all UoMs. If you wish to restrict decimal places or fractions for a specific UoM, follow these steps:

### 1.1 Accessing the UoM List

1. Navigate to: **Stock > Setup > UoM**.
2. From the list of UoMs, select the UoM for which you want to restrict decimal values. For example, let's assume the UoM is **Nos**.

### 1.2 Configuring the UoM

1. In the **UoM Master**, look for the field labeled **Must be Whole Number**.
2. Check this field to restrict users from entering decimal values in the quantity field for items assigned this UoM.

UoM Must be Whole Number

## 2. Validation of Decimal Values

Once you have configured the UoM to restrict decimal values, ERPZ will validate the quantity during transactions. If you attempt to enter a fractional quantity for an item with a UoM that has the **Must be Whole Number** option checked, you will receive an error message, stating:


This validation ensures that all quantities conform to the whole number requirement, thereby maintaining consistency in inventory management and transactions.
