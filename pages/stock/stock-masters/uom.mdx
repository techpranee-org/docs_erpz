# Unit of Measure (UoM)

**A Unit of Measure (UoM)** is a standardized unit used to quantify an item in ERPZ. It defines how an item is measured in inventory, sales, and purchasing transactions.

By default, ERPZ provides a list of common UoMs, but you can add more UoMs based on your specific business needs.

## 1. UoM Settings

In the UoM settings, there is an option labeled **Must be Whole Number**. If this option is checked, you will only be able to use whole numbers for this UoM, meaning fractional quantities will not be allowed.

For example:
- If **Must be Whole Number** is checked for "Piece," you can only order items in quantities like 1, 2, or 3 Pieces, but not 1.5 Pieces.

To learn more about using fractional UoMs, please refer to [UoM Fractions](./uom-fractions.mdx).

## 2. UoM Conversion Factor

While the UoM list stores only the unit name (e.g., Kilogram, Pound, Liter), the **UoM Conversion Factor** document stores the actual conversion rates between different UoMs.

For example, if 1 Kilogram (Kg) is approximately equal to 2.2 Pounds (Lb), the conversion factor between Kg and Lb will be recorded in the **UoM Conversion Factor** document.

It is important to define conversion factors if you plan to use custom UoMs that will be converted to other units in transactions. For example:
- **1 Kg = 2.20462 Lb**
- **1 Meter = 100 Centimeters**

By defining these conversion factors, ERPZ can automatically handle conversions during transactions, ensuring consistency across sales, purchases, and stock management.

## 3. How to Create a New UoM

To create a new UoM in ERPZ, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **UoM List**: **Home > Stock > Settings > UoM**.
2. Click on **Add UoM**.
3. Enter the name of the UoM (e.g., Box, Dozen, Carton).
4. If required, check the box for **Must be Whole Number**.
5. Save the UoM.

## 4. How to Set UoM Conversion Factor

Once the UoM is created, you can set the conversion factor by following these steps:

1. Go to **Home > Stock > Settings > UoM Conversion Factor**.
2. Click on **New**.
3. Select the item for which the conversion applies.
4. Enter the **From UoM** (e.g., Kg) and **To UoM** (e.g., Lb).
5. Specify the conversion factor (e.g., 1 Kg = 2.20462 Lb).
6. Save the conversion factor.

---

## 5. Example

If you have an item measured in **Kilograms (Kg)** and you want to convert it to **Pounds (Lb)**, set the conversion factor as follows:

```md
| From UoM | To UoM | Conversion Factor |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Kilogram | Pound  | 2.20462           |
```
