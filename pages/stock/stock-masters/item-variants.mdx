# Item Variants

An **Item Variant** is a version of an Item that has different attributes such as size, color, or other characteristics. 

For example, if a t-shirt comes in different sizes and colors like small, medium, large, and red, blue, green, in ERPZ, the t-shirt is considered as an **Item Template**. Each of the variations, such as a blue t-shirt in size small, would be an **Item Variant**.

Item Variants allow you to manage products with multiple variations under one item template, rather than treating each variation as a separate item. For example, _small_, _medium_, and _large_ versions of a t-shirt can all be managed as variants of one item, ‘t-shirt’.

## 1. Using Item Variants

Item Variants in ERPZ can be based on two things:

- **Item Attributes** (e.g., size, color)
- **Manufacturers** (if different manufacturers produce variants)

> **Tip:** Once an Item Template is created, updates made to the template are automatically applied to all variants.

### 1.1 Creating the Item Variant Template

To use Item Variants in ERPZ, follow these steps:

1. Create an Item.
2. Tick the checkbox for **Has Variants** under the Variants section.

This item will now be referred to as a **Template**. It will no longer function like a regular item (i.e., you cannot use the Template itself in Sales Orders, Delivery Notes, or Purchase Invoices).

> Only **Variants** of the Item (e.g., a blue t-shirt in size small) can be used in transactions.

When you select **Has Variants**, a table will appear where you can specify the variant attributes for the item. If an attribute has numeric values (e.g., size), you can specify a range and create intervals based on increment values.

> **Note:** Transactions cannot be made against an Item Template.

### 1.2 Creating Item Variants Based on Attributes

To create **Item Variants** based on attributes:

1. Go to the Item Template and click on **Create**.
2. Select whether to create a single variant or multiple variants:
   - **Single Variant:** You can create one variant with specific attributes.
   - **Multiple Variants:** Select multiple attributes (e.g., Color: Red, Green; Size: Small, Medium) and ERPZ will generate all possible variants automatically.

For example, selecting Color: Red, Green and Size: Small, Medium, Large will generate six variants (Red Small, Red Medium, Red Large, Green Small, Green Medium, Green Large).

### 1.3 Item Variants Based on Manufacturers

To create variants based on Manufacturers:

1. In the Item Template, set the "Variants Based On" field to **Manufacturers**.
2. Click on **Create > Make Variant**. You will be prompted to select a Manufacturer and optionally provide a Manufacturer Part Number.

The variant will be named based on the template item name with a number suffix. For example, the template "Screwdriver" will have variants such as "Screwdriver-1", "Screwdriver-2", etc.

## 2. Update Item Variants Based on Template

You can update all item variants at once based on the Item Template. To do this:

1. Navigate to: **Home > Stock > Items and Pricing > Item Variant Settings**.
2. In this section, specify the fields that should be copied from the template to all variants. By default, all fields are displayed, but you can delete rows for fields that you don’t want to update.
