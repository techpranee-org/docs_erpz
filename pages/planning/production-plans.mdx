# Production Plan

A Production Plan assists in production and material planning for items designated for manufacturing. These production items can be committed via **Sales Orders** (to customers) or **Material Requests** (internally).

The Production Plan helps users plan production against multiple Sales Orders or Material Requests. Additionally, it aids in material procurement planning for raw materials based on the quantities of finished products to be manufactured.



## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and utilizing a Production Plan, ensure you have created the following:

- Item
- Material Request
- Sales Order
- Bill of Materials
