# Introduction

## What is an ERP system? And why should businesses use it?

If you're already convinced that you need an all-in-one enterprise solution for your organization, you can skip this page.

In today’s world, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face challenges that are similar to large enterprises, especially in resource planning and management. Although SMEs operate with fewer resources, the complexity of managing their operations can be just as daunting.

Much like large corporations, small businesses need to:

- Manage accounts, sales, and purchases
- File taxes accurately
- Process employee payroll
- Deliver products and services on time
- Ensure high-quality offerings
- Communicate effectively with customers and address their inquiries

Large enterprises have long relied on costly, complex ERP systems like SAP to manage their global operations. These systems allow companies to consolidate data and streamline fundamental processes such as accounting, supply chain management, taxation, and payroll.

However, for SMEs, such expensive systems have often been inaccessible, leaving them behind in the digital transformation wave of the past two decades. High costs and complex customizations make these solutions impractical for smaller businesses, which typically rely on spreadsheets, simple accounting software, and scattered tools. This siloed approach often prevents them from obtaining valuable insights and optimizing their processes.
