# Concepts and Terms

Before you start implementing ERPZ, let's get familiar with the terminology used and some basic concepts in ERPZ.

## Basic Concepts

### Company
Represents the company records for which ERPZ is set up. You can create multiple company records, each representing a different legal entity. The accounting for each company will be different, but they will share the customer, supplier, and item records.

### Customer
Represents a customer, which can be either an individual or an organization. You can create multiple contacts and addresses for each customer.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Path**: `Selling > Customer`
</Callout>


### Supplier
Represents a supplier of goods or services. Your telecommunications company is a supplier, as is your raw materials supplier. A supplier can also be an individual or an organization and can have multiple contacts and addresses.

</Callout>


### Item
A product, sub-product, or service that is either bought, sold, or manufactured and is uniquely identified.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Path**: `Stock > Item`
</Callout>


### Account
An account is a heading under which financial and business transactions are conducted. Examples of accounts include "Debtors", "Creditors", "VAT Payable", “Travel Expenses”, "Sales", and "Share Capital". ERPZ tracks customer and supplier balances in the background, so you don’t need to create dedicated accounts for them.

### Address
An address represents the location details of a customer or supplier. These can be different locations such as Head Office, Factory, Warehouse, or Shop.

### Contact
An individual contact associated with a customer or supplier, or an independent contact. A contact has a name and contact details like email and phone number.

### Communication

## Accounting Concepts

### Fiscal Year
Represents a financial year or accounting year. You can operate multiple fiscal years simultaneously. Each fiscal year has a start date and an end date, and transactions can only be recorded within this period. When you close a fiscal year, its balances are transferred as “opening” balances for the next fiscal year.

  **Path**: `Setup > Company > Fiscal Year`
</Callout>


### Cost Center
A cost center is like an account, but its structure represents your business more closely than accounts. In your chart of accounts, you can separate your expenses by type (i.e., travel, marketing, etc.), while in your chart of cost centers, you can separate them by product line or business group (e.g., online sales, retail sales, etc.).
