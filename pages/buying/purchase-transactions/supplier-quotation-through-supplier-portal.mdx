# Create Supplier Quotation through Supplier Portal

In ERPZ, Supplier Quotations can be created either manually or via the Supplier Portal. Suppliers can create Quotations through the Supplier Portal after logging into the system.

## Pre-requisites

- The Supplier must be a registered Website User with the "Supplier" role.
- The Supplier user account's Contact must be linked to the Supplier document.

To create a Supplier Quotation, there must be an existing Request for Quotation (RFQ) associated with the supplier. Follow the steps below to complete the process:

## Steps to Create a Supplier Quotation

### Step 1: Create a Request for Quotation (RFQ)

1. Create a Request for Quotation for the Supplier in the system. For this example, we are creating an RFQ for **MNO Suppliers**.

### Step 2: Supplier Logs into the Supplier Portal

2. The Supplier (MNO Suppliers in this case) must log into the Supplier Portal using their login credentials. Once logged in, the Supplier will be able to view the RFQ.

### Step 3: Enter Item Rate and Submit RFQ

3. The Supplier should enter the Item Rate and submit the RFQ.

### Step 4: Automatic Creation of Supplier Quotation

Once the RFQ is submitted, a Supplier Quotation will automatically be created in the system against this RFQ. 

- Click on the **View** option to access the Supplier Quotation.

### Step 5: Review and Submit the Supplier Quotation

Observe that the Supplier Quotation is initially in the Draft state. After reviewing the Supplier Quotation, the user can submit it. This action will also be reflected in the Supplier Portal.

> **Note:** Ensure that all information is accurate before submission to avoid any discrepancies.
