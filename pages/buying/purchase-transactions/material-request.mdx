# Material Request in ERPZ

A Material Request is a simple document identifying a requirement for a set of items (products or services) for a particular reason. ERPZ facilitates the creation and management of Material Requests to streamline procurement and inventory management.

## Purposes of a Material Request

A Material Request can have the following purposes:

- **Purchase**: To acquire materials through purchase.
- **Material Transfer**: To shift materials from one warehouse to another.
- **Material Issue**: To issue materials for purposes such as manufacturing.
- **Manufacture**: To request materials for production.
- **Customer Provided**: To specify materials that will be provided by a customer. For more information, visit the [Customer Provided Item](#) page.

## Accessing Material Requests

To access the Material Request list, navigate to:

**Home > Stock > Stock Transactions > Material Request**

## 1. How to Create a Material Request

1. Go to the Material Request list and click on **Add Material Request**.
2. Enter the **Required By** date.
3. Select the appropriate purpose from the list.
4. Fetch items from a Bill of Materials (BOM), Sales Order, or Product Bundle.
5. Select the item and set the quantity.
6. Select the warehouse for which items are required.
7. Optionally, change the Required By date for individual items in the table.
8. Save and Submit the request.

### 1.1 Alternate Ways of Creating a Material Request

Material Requests can be generated automatically:

- **From a Sales Order**: While creating a Material Request, users can choose to ignore or include Projected Quantity, fetching relevant items from Sales Orders.
- **When Projected Quantity Reaches a Level**: Automatically create requests when stock levels dip below a predefined threshold.
- **From a Production Plan**: Generate Material Requests based on planned manufacturing activities.

> **Info**: Material Requests are not mandatory but are ideal for centralized buying, allowing collection of procurement information from various departments.

### 1.2 Statuses of a Material Request

A Material Request can be in the following statuses:

- **Draft**: Saved but not submitted.
- **Submitted**: Document is submitted for processing.
- **Stopped**: No further materials are needed; the request is halted.
- **Canceled**: Materials are not required, and the request is canceled.
- **Pending**: Awaiting completion of Purchase/Manufacture.
- **Partially Ordered**: Some items have been ordered, while others remain pending.
- **Ordered**: All items in the request have been ordered via Purchase Orders.
- **Issued**: Materials issued through a Material Issue Stock Entry.
- **Transferred**: Materials transferred from one warehouse to another.
- **Received**: Materials ordered have been received at the designated warehouse.
