# Debit Note

**A Debit Note is a document sent by a buyer to the supplier, notifying that a debit has been recorded against the goods returned to the supplier.**

A Debit Note is issued for the value of the goods returned. In some cases, sellers may issue Debit Notes that should be treated as a separate invoice. A Debit Note serves as a record of the debit against the items being returned.

## 1. How to Create a Debit Note

Users can create a Debit Note against a Purchase Invoice or directly create a Debit Note from the Purchase Invoice without reference.

1. Navigate to the respective Purchase Invoice and click on **Create > Return / Debit Note**. 
   - The Supplier and Item details will be fetched as set in the Purchase Invoice.
   - If a partial or full payment was made, make a Payment Entry against the original Purchase Invoice.
2. Save and Submit the Debit Note.

For any additional details, refer to the Purchase Invoice page.

## 1.2 No Payment Was Made Against the Sales Invoice

In cases where **no payment** was made against the original invoice, you could simply cancel the Sales Invoice. However, if only a portion of the items (e.g., 5 out of 10 items) are being returned from an invoice, creating a Debit Note is useful for updating the ledger accordingly.

## 2. Example

From Supplier Blue Mills, you purchased cotton worth Rs 2400 + taxes. Upon delivery, you found that the products were damaged. You will issue a Debit Note to return the product.
