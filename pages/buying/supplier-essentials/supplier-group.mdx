# Supplier Group

**Supplier Group is an aggregation of suppliers that share common characteristics.**

In the context of procurement, a supplier is distinct from a contractor or subcontractor, who typically contributes specialized inputs to deliverables. A supplier, often referred to as a vendor, can be categorized based on the types of goods and products they provide.

ERPZ allows you to create customized categories for your suppliers, known as Supplier Groups. For instance, if your suppliers primarily include pharmaceutical companies and FMCG distributors, you can create distinct Supplier Groups and name them accordingly.

## Accessing Supplier Group

To access the Supplier Group feature, navigate to:

`Home > Buying > Supplier > Supplier Group`


## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and utilizing a Supplier Group, it is recommended to create the following:

- **Supplier**: Ensure that you have established supplier records before grouping them.

## 2. How to Create a Supplier Group

Follow these steps to create a Supplier Group:

1. Go to the Supplier Group list and click on **New**.
2. Enter a name for your new Supplier Group.
3. Optionally, set a Parent Supplier Group for this group.
4. Tick the **Is Group** checkbox to designate it as a Parent Supplier Group.
5. You can assign a default Payment Terms Template to the Supplier Group, which is useful for cases where all suppliers under this group have the same payment terms (e.g., half payment on sales order and half post-shipment).
6. Click **Save**.

### 2.1 Supplier Classification

ERPZ provides a range of options to classify your suppliers. You can choose from categories such as Distributor, Electrical, Hardware, Local, Pharmaceutical, Raw Material, Services, etc. This classification simplifies accounting and payment processes.

## 3. Supplier Group Tree

You can also structure Supplier Groups hierarchically, similar to a Chart of Accounts. 

To view the tree structure, click on **Tree** from the sidebar. To return to the list view, select: **Menu > View List**.

### 3.1 Hierarchical Permissions

With the new User Permissions feature, you can apply hierarchy-based permissions. If a user is permitted to view a parent Supplier Group, they will automatically gain access to its child nodes.

For example, if a user has permission to view the 'Distributor' document, they will also be able to view its child nodes, such as 'Book Distributor', 'Electronic Distributor', etc.
