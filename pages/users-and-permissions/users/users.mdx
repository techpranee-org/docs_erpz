# Users in ERPZ

In ERPZ, user management involves creating and managing user accounts, assigning roles based on job responsibilities, and configuring access levels. This ensures that each user has the appropriate permissions to access the necessary modules and features of the system.

## Key User Types

### 1. Administrator
Administrators have full control over the ERPZ system. They can create and manage users, assign roles, and configure settings for all modules. Administrators can also define custom permissions for specific modules and actions, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information.

### 2. User
Standard users can access the system based on the roles and permissions assigned to them. They interact with various modules, perform their daily tasks, and update information relevant to their roles.

### 3. Limited User
Limited users have restricted access to the ERPZ system. They are typically assigned specific roles with permissions only to view or edit limited information. This user type is ideal for external partners or employees with minimal access requirements.

## Roles and Role Profiles

ERPZ allows administrators to create and assign **roles** to users based on their responsibilities within the organization. Each role is linked to specific modules and features, defining what the user can view, edit, or create.

### 1. Role Profiles
To streamline role management, **Role Profiles** in ERPZ combine multiple roles into predefined sets of permissions. This feature simplifies assigning roles to users by grouping common roles under one profile. For example, a "Sales Manager" profile might include roles for handling sales orders, managing customers, and generating sales reports.
