# Adding Users in ERPZ

Users in ERPZ can be added and managed by the **System Manager**. To add users, navigate to: **Home > Users and Permissions > User**.

There are two main types of users:

- **Website users**: These include customers, suppliers, or external parties who can access the portal but do not have access to system modules.
- **System users**: Internal users who have access to ERPZ's modules and company data.

## 1. How to Create a New User

1. Go to the **User list** and click on **New**.
2. Enter the user’s email address and name.
3. Save.

### Add User Details

- Enter additional details like **Username** and **Language**.
- The **Email address** serves as the unique ID for the user.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Setting Roles

After saving the user, you can assign roles by selecting checkboxes next to the available roles. Each role has predefined permissions. Learn more about roles [here](#). **Role profiles** can be used to select multiple roles at once.

### 2.2 Additional Information

You can provide more details about the user, such as:

- **Gender**
- **Phone**
- **Mobile Number**
- **Birth Date**
- **Location**
- **Interests**
- **Bio**
- **Banner Image**

You can also enable **Mute Sounds**, which mutes sound notifications when interacting with documents.

### 2.3 Change Password

As a System Manager, you can change a user’s password:

- **Set New Password**: Reset the user's password.
- **Send Password Update Notification**: Notify the user via email that their password has been changed.
- **Log out from all devices**: Force log out from all devices when resetting the password.

### 2.4 Document Follow

Users can follow documents in the system and receive email notifications when those documents are updated. [Learn more](#).

### 2.5 Email Settings

Manage the user's email preferences:

- **Send Notifications for Email Threads**: Enable notifications for document-related emails.
- **Send Me A Copy of Outgoing Emails**: Sends a copy of outgoing emails to the user.
- **Allowed In Mentions**: Enable the user's name to appear in thread conversations for mentions.
- **Email Signature**: Set a default email signature for outgoing emails.

### 2.6 Email Inbox

You can subscribe users to your company’s mailing lists. Simply add a new row and select a mailing list (e.g., jobs, support, sales). [Learn more about the Email Inbox](#).

### 2.7 Allow Module Access

System users will have access to all modules based on their role permissions. To restrict module access, uncheck the modules you wish to block.

#### 2.7.1 Module Profiles

**Module Profiles** act as templates to assign access to multiple modules at once. For example, an HR user can be given access to the HR, Payroll, and Attendance modules through a single profile.

### 2.8 Security Settings

- **Simultaneous Sessions**: Specify how many simultaneous login sessions the user is allowed. For cloud-hosted accounts, the number of sessions is limited by the total number of subscribed users.
- **User Type**: If the user has roles other than Customer, Supplier, or External Partner, they are classified as a **System User** (read-only).
- **Login After/Before**: Set access times to restrict login to specific hours (e.g., office hours).
- **Restrict IP**: Restrict the user’s login to specified IP addresses (useful for office-only access).

Security settings also display details like **Last Login**, **Last IP**, and **Last Active** time.

### 2.9 Third-Party Authentication

You can allow users to log in using third-party providers like Facebook, Google, or GitHub. To enable this, create an app with the provider, then input the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into ERPZ.

### 2.10 API Access

Generate API secret keys from this section using the **Generate Keys** button. These keys enable access to ERPZ data from other applications.

## 3. Login Methods

ERPZ supports multiple login methods:

- **Login with Email**: Standard login using an email address.
- **Login with Mobile Number**: If enabled in system settings, users can log in using their mobile number.

## 4. Impersonating a User

Administrators can impersonate other users to troubleshoot issues. This feature is new in version 15.

> An activity log is created whenever an Administrator impersonates a user, and the impersonated user will be notified.
