# Administrator in ERPZ

The **Administrator** in ERPZ holds the highest level of access within the system, with all rights and permissions to manage every aspect of an ERPZ account. The Administrator ensures that the ERPZ system runs smoothly and meets the organization's operational needs.

While **System Managers** also have extensive permissions within the system, the Administrator's access is unrestricted. They oversee critical tasks such as user management, module configuration, and system-wide settings.

## Cloud-Hosted ERPZ Accounts

If your ERPZ account is cloud-hosted by us (ERPZ Technologies Pvt. Ltd.), the Administrator access is managed by our backend team. In these cases, users will not have direct access to the Administrator account for security and system maintenance reasons.

For cloud-hosted accounts, upgrades and system maintenance are handled directly from the backend. We retain Administrator login credentials to manage these processes efficiently, ensuring that all ERPZ accounts receive timely updates and support. 

Since multiple ERPZ accounts may be hosted on a single server, as a security measure, Administrator credentials are not shared with cloud-hosted users. However, in specific cases—such as purchasing a dedicated server for a large number of users—exclusive Administrator access may be granted.

## Self-Hosted ERPZ Accounts

For self-hosted ERPZ accounts, Administrator credentials are fully under the control of the account user. This allows businesses to manage the system independently, including performing upgrades and custom configurations.
