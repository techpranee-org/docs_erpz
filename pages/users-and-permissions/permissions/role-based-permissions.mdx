# Role Based Permissions

In ERPZ, permissions to different documents are controlled using Role-Based Permissions. This system allows you to assign roles to users and configure permissions for each role, determining what actions (e.g., read, write, submit) can be performed on specific documents.

The Role Permissions Manager in ERPZ enables fine-grained control over access to various documents, based on the roles assigned to users.

## 1. How to Use the Role Permissions Manager

To start managing role-based permissions, follow these steps:

- Navigate to **Home > Users and Permissions > Role Permissions Manager**.
- Use the Role Permissions Manager to manage Read, Write, Create, Submit, Amend, and other access rights for different roles.

Permissions are based on the following factors:

- **Roles**: Roles are assigned to users, and permission rules are applied to those roles. Examples of roles include Accounts Manager, Sales User, and HR Manager.
- **Document Types**: Permissions can be assigned to specific document types like Sales Order, Purchase Order, Invoice, etc.
- **Permission Levels**: Fields in a document can be grouped by permission levels, allowing different permission rules for each group. The default permission level is 0 for most fields.
- **Document Stages**: Permissions can be applied at different stages of a document’s lifecycle—Creation, Submission, Cancellation, Amendment, etc.
- **User Permissions**: These allow restrictions based on specific document values, such as limiting access to a certain customer or territory.

### 1.1 Adding a New Permission Rule

To add a new rule:

1. Open the Role Permissions Manager and click **Add New Rule**.
2. Select the **Role** and the **Permission Level**.
3. Click **Add**, and a new row will be added to the table for configuring permissions.

### 1.2 User Permissions

In ERPZ, you can restrict user access to specific documents using User Permissions. For example, you can limit a sales user to view only documents related to a specific company or customer.

To configure user permissions:

- Go to **Home > Users and Permissions > User Permissions**.
- Select the user and the document type (e.g., Sales Order).
- Define the restrictions by setting values for fields like Customer, Company, or Territory.

## 2. Role-Based Permissions in Action

Here’s an example using **Leave Application** to demonstrate how role-based permissions work:

1. An **Employee** role should have Read, Write, and Create permissions for their own leave applications.
2. A **HR Manager** role should have access to all leave applications, with permissions to read, submit, and cancel.
3. A **Leave Approver** role can view and update leave applications for employees under their supervision.
4. To approve or reject leave applications, the **HR User** or **Leave Approver** roles can have elevated permissions for specific fields, such as the **Status** field, which may have a higher permission level (e.g., Level 1).

Permissions can be fine-tuned based on specific document stages or fields, ensuring that sensitive information is protected and access is granted only to authorized users.

## 3. Advanced Permissions

ERPZ provides additional control through advanced permission settings:

- **Permission Levels**: Control access to specific fields within a document.
- **Document Stages**: Apply permissions based on the document’s stage, such as submission or cancellation.
- **Set User Permissions**: This option allows users with certain roles (e.g., HR Manager) to delegate permissions to others for specific document types.

For example, the **HR Manager** can delegate access to leave applications to subordinates by configuring user permissions for the **Leave Application** document.

## 4. Troubleshooting Permissions Issues

If users encounter permission-related errors, ensure that roles are correctly assigned and user permissions are properly configured. In case of conflicts, the **Role Permissions Manager** can be used to review and resolve permission issues.
