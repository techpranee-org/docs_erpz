# Field Level Permission Management

In ERPZ, restricting access to specific fields based on user roles can be easily managed using **Perm Level**. This functionality is essential for organizations that want to control the visibility or editability of certain fields for specific roles.

Let's walk through a scenario where your organization doesn't want an **Employee** (e.g., **Accounts User**) to edit the **Item Rate** field while creating a Sales Invoice. To achieve this, we can make the **Item Rate** field read-only for the **Accounts User** role.

## 1. Setting Field Permissions Using Perm Level

Follow these steps to restrict the field access:

1. Navigate to **Customize Form**, and select the **DocType** as **Sales Invoice Item**.
2. Scroll to the **Item Rate** field and expand its settings.

3. In the **Perm Level** field, enter the desired level (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.), and then **Save** the customization.

## 2. Configuring Role Permissions

Once you've set the **Perm Level** for the field, follow these steps to define the permissions for the user role:

1. Go to the **Role Permission Manager**, click **Add a New Rule**, and select the **Document Type** as **Sales Invoice** and the **Role** as **Accounts User**.
2. Set the **Perm Level** as 2 and grant the Employee **Read** access for that level.

Here’s how the **Role Permissions Manager** will display the new rule with **Perm Level 2**:

## 3. Outcome: Restricted Field in Sales Invoice

Now, when an **Accounts User** creates a **Sales Invoice**, they will only be able to **read** the **Item Rate** field, which will automatically be fetched from the **Price List**. The user won’t have the ability to edit the rate, maintaining the integrity of the data.
