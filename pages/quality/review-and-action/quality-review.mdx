## Quality Review

**A Quality Review** is a structured record of performance against Quality Goals, conducted at regular intervals to ensure products meet quality standards.

The **Quality Review** is designed to assess whether all objectives of a Quality Goal have been achieved, providing a systematic approach to quality assurance.

### Accessing Quality Review

To access the **Quality Review** list, navigate to:

`Home > Quality > Review and Action > Quality Review`
