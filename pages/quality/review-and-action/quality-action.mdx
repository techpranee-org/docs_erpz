## Quality Action

**A Quality Action** is initiated based on a **Quality Review** to address unsatisfactory results or to prevent future occurrences of such issues.

Quality Actions serve as a standardized method for implementing corrective and preventive measures, ensuring compliance with industry regulations, including GMP, ISO 9001, ISO 14001, TSCA, REACH, and more.

The **Quality Action** workflows provide a controlled environment, significantly reducing the risk of recurring issues by ensuring that established solutions and processes are effectively followed.

Quality Actions can be initiated for a **Quality Goal** or in response to **Customer Feedback** that does not meet the expected quality standards. Depending on the situation, either a Corrective Action or a Preventive Action can be initiated.
