## Review and Action

In **ERPZ**, the **Quality Review** and **Actions** are essential components for maintaining high standards across all operations.

### 1. Quality Review

Quality Reviews involve assessing products, services, or processes against predefined criteria to ensure they align with established quality standards. **ERPZ** supports this by offering tools that allow organizations to:

- Define specific quality parameters.
- Conduct thorough inspections.
- Document review results effectively.

### 2. Quality Action

Based on the outcomes of these reviews, organizations can initiate corrective and preventive actions directly within the system. This includes:

- **Corrective Actions**: Addressing immediate quality issues identified during reviews.
- **Preventive Actions**: Implementing strategies to prevent future quality problems.

This streamlined approach enables organizations to promptly address quality issues, implement necessary improvements, and continuously enhance overall quality performance.

### 3. Non-Conformance Management

Through the **Non-Conformance** management feature, ERPZ allows users to track and manage deviations from quality standards, ensuring that corrective actions are taken to resolve these non-conformances effectively.

By integrating **Quality Reviews** and **Actions**, **ERPZ** empowers organizations to maintain high-quality standards, improve operational efficiency, and drive continuous improvement in their quality management processes.
