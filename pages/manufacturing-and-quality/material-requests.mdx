# Material Request

A **Material Request** in ERPZ is a document used to identify a requirement for a set of items (products or services) for a particular reason. It helps streamline procurement, production, and inventory planning processes.

A Material Request can serve the following purposes:

- **Purchase:** If the material being requested is to be purchased.
- **Material Transfer:** If the material is to be shifted from one warehouse to another.
- **Material Issue:** If the material is required for internal use, such as manufacturing or repair.
- **Manufacture:** If the material is required for production purposes.
- **Customer Provided:** If the material is provided by a customer for specific processes. To learn more, visit the Customer Provided Item section.
