# Supplier Quote

## Overview
A **Supplier Quote** in ERPZ is a document submitted by a supplier detailing the pricing and terms for goods or services offered to a business. It serves as an initial response to a request for quotation (RFQ) issued by the business, outlining specific details such as item prices, quantities, lead times, and other terms of supply. This document provides a foundation for negotiation and comparison across different suppliers, helping a business make an informed purchasing decision.

## 1. Significance
The Supplier Quote feature is a crucial part of ERPZ's procurement module, offering several key benefits:

- **Cost Optimization:** By comparing quotes from multiple suppliers, businesses can choose the most cost-effective options.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** Storing all supplier quotes in a centralized system ensures transparency in the procurement process, providing a clear record of price offerings.
- **Efficient Supplier Management:** Quotes allow businesses to track supplier reliability and responsiveness, which is useful for long-term supplier relationships.
- **Decision Support:** With detailed information on pricing, lead times, and terms, businesses can make well-informed decisions based on their procurement priorities.

The Supplier Quote feature integrates with other ERPZ modules such as Purchase Orders and Inventory Management, making it a vital part of an efficient procurement workflow.
