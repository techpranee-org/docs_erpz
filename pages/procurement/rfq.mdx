# Request for Quotation (RFQ)

A **Request for Quotation (RFQ)** in ERPZ is a formal process where a company invites suppliers to submit price quotes for specific products or services. The RFQ is a key step in procurement, allowing businesses to compare offerings, negotiate terms, and ensure cost-effectiveness.

## 1. Significance in ERPZ

1. **Cost Efficiency**: By collecting and comparing quotes from multiple suppliers, businesses can choose the most cost-effective option, helping reduce procurement costs.
2. **Supplier Management**: RFQs streamline supplier communication, creating a clear record of terms, pricing, and specifications, which aids in relationship management and accountability.
3. **Transparency & Compliance**: Standardizing RFQs in ERPZ ensures procurement transparency, which is especially important for audit trails and regulatory compliance.
4. **Decision Support**: RFQs enable better purchasing decisions by presenting all relevant supplier data in a centralized system, helping the team make informed choices.

In ERPZ, an RFQ can be linked to the entire supply chain, affecting inventory, purchase orders, and ultimately the production flow.
