# Purchase Order

A Purchase Order is a binding contract with your Supplier that you promise to buy a set of items under given conditions.

It is similar to a Sales Order but instead of sending it to an external party, you keep it for internal records.


## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and using a Purchase Order, it is advised that you create the following first:

- Supplier
