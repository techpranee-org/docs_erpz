# Sales Invoice from Timesheet

In ERPZ, a customer can be billed based on the total number of hours an employee has worked for that customer. The actual number of billable hours can be tracked through a **Timesheet**.

**A sales invoice can be generated from each Timesheet submitted by an employee, which can be used to bill the customer.**

## 1. How to Create A Sales Invoice from A Timesheet

Once the Timesheet is submitted, follow these steps to create a sales invoice:

1. **Click on 'Create Sales Invoice'**: After submitting the Timesheet, click on the option to create a sales invoice.
2. **Enter Item Code and Customer Name**: Fill in the Item Code and select the Customer who should be billed for the logged hours. The Item can represent either a Product or a Service.
3. **Generate Sales Invoice**: Click on 'Create Sales Invoice.' All relevant details from the Timesheet will be auto-populated into the Sales Invoice.
4. **Edit Posting Date and Time**: The posting date and time will be set to the current date and time by default. You can modify these after checking the box below Posting Time if needed.
5. **Optional Settings**: Optionally, include payments for Point of Sale (POS) transactions or convert this invoice into a credit note.
6. **Save and Submit**: After reviewing the details, save and submit the invoice.

To automatically fetch details into the Sales Invoice, click on the **Get items from** button. You can retrieve information from a Sales Order, Delivery Note, or Quotation. This will auto-populate details like Customer PO, Address, Contact Number, Currency, Price List, and Items.

## 2. Features

When creating a Sales Invoice from a Timesheet, the following additional details can be included:

- **Accounting Dimensions**: This feature allows you to tag transactions to specific Territories, Branches, Projects, etc. This tagging aids in viewing accounting statements separately based on the criteria selected. For more information, visit the Accounting Dimensions page.

- **Timesheet List**: Since the project is created from a Timesheet, the details of the Timesheet will be auto-fetched. You can click on 'Add Row' to include additional Timesheets in this invoice.

All other necessary details can be added just as you would for any standard Sales Invoice.

## 3. After Submitting

Once the Sales Invoice has been submitted, the Timesheet will automatically update to reflect details such as 'Total Billed Hours', 'Total Billed Amount', and '% Amount Billed.' Additionally, a Salary Slip can also be generated from the Timesheet, ensuring a seamless process of billing and payroll management in ERPZ.

By utilizing the Sales Invoice feature linked to Timesheets, organizations can ensure accurate billing for hours worked while maintaining transparency in employee compensation.
