# Time Based Payout

**Time-based payout** in ERPZ projects refers to the method of calculating and disbursing payments to employees or contractors based on the actual time they have dedicated to specific projects or tasks.

This feature is especially beneficial in industries where billing is linked to hourly rates or tied to milestone achievements. ERPZ streamlines the time-based payout process by accurately tracking the hours logged by individuals against their respective project tasks or milestones. This ensures organizations can set appropriate hourly rates or payment terms for different roles or projects, guaranteeing fair and transparent compensation for the work completed.

## 1. Key Features of Time-Based Payout in ERPZ

1. **Accurate Time Tracking**: Employees can log their hours worked on specific tasks or projects, providing precise data for billing and payroll calculations.

2. **Customizable Payment Terms**: Organizations can define hourly rates for various roles, ensuring compensation reflects the skills and responsibilities of each position.

3. **Integration with Invoicing**: Time entries can be directly linked to sales invoices, enabling easy billing based on the time logged against projects. This simplifies the process of generating invoices for clients based on the hours worked.
