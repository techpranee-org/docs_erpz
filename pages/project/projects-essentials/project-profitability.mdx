## Project Profitability

Projects and related activities are generally active for longer periods. As new developments occur in a project, various transactions are done against it. These developments may lead to more investment in terms of time, money, and material. Therefore, it's important to track the profitability of a project to ensure that you don't overspend.

In simple terms, **Project Profitability** is the difference between the revenue generated from a project versus the costs associated with it.

### 1. Project in Sales Transactions

You can link a project in all sales transactions like Sales Orders, Delivery Notes, Sales Invoices, and Payments. Linking your project with sales transactions will help you track the income received for that project.

In sales transactions, the **Project** field is generally available in the **More Information** section.

### 2. Project in Purchase Transactions

You can also link your project to purchase transactions like Purchase Orders, Purchase Receipts, and Purchase Invoices.

In purchase transactions, the option to link a project is available in the **Item Table**. This is useful when procuring materials for multiple projects from the same purchase entry.

### 3. Budgeting against Projects

You can create a **Budget** for a project as well. The expense limit defined in the budget will be validated in the expense transactions.

### 4. Project Profitability

Based on all the income and expense entries created for the project, you can assess its profitability.

Navigate to: **Accounting > Profitability Analysis**

You can filter the report by Project to check project-wise profitability.
