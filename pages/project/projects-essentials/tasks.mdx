# Tasks

In project management, a task is a defined unit of work that is necessary to achieve a larger goal within a project.

To access Tasks in ERPZ, navigate to:

`Home > Projects > Tasks > Task`

## 1. How to Create a Task

1. Go to the **Task** list and click on **New**.
2. Add the task's subject (title).
3. Click **Save**.

Alternatively, you can create a task directly from a Project by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the Project you want to add the task to.
2. In the Project section on the dashboard, go to the **Tasks** tab and click the **+** icon.
3. Enter the task’s subject (title).
4. Click **Save**.

You can further customize tasks by adding the following details:

- **Status**: Set the task’s status, such as 'Open', 'In Progress', 'Completed', or 'Cancelled'.
- **Project**: Link the task to an existing project. If the task was created from a project, this field will auto-populate.
- **Priority**: Set the priority level (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) based on its importance.
- **Weight**: Assign a weight to the task to indicate its importance or effort level, especially for tasks contributing to overall project completion.
- **Type**: Specify the task type (e.g., Research, Development) to categorize it for filtering purposes.
- **Color**: Choose a color for the task, useful when visualizing tasks in Gantt charts.
- **Is Group**: Mark a task as a parent task by checking this option, which allows it to have sub-tasks.
