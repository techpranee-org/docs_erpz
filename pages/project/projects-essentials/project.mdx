# Project

**A Project in ERPZ is a planned piece of work aimed at achieving specific objectives, such as producing new outcomes, gathering information, or improving existing processes.**

In ERPZ, project management is task-driven. You can create a project and divide it into multiple tasks for better tracking and management.

A Project generally has a broad scope and can be broken down into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, launching a new product could be a project, with tasks like design, development, testing, and delivery under it.

## Accessing Projects

To access Projects in ERPZ:

**Navigate to:**

`Home > Projects > Projects > Project`
