## Project Views

As projects are time-sensitive, it's important to have different types of views to visually convey information to users.

In addition to the generic list and report views for projects and tasks, **ERPZ** also provides **Gantt**, **Kanban**, and **List** views for tasks. You can access these views by navigating to the **Task List** and selecting the desired view via the left sidebar.

### 1. Gantt View

A **Gantt Chart** visually represents how tasks are linked to each other and shows their execution sequence, based on the start and end dates set for each task, along with any dependencies.

You can adjust the range of the chart by selecting one of the following: Quarter Day, Half Day, Day, Week, or Month.

Tasks can be dragged along the timeline to update their start and end dates.

> If you want to further customize the chart and make it more colorful, read the [customizing Gantt Chart]() article.

### 2. Kanban View

**Kanban** is a visual task management method that traces its origins back to Toyotaâ€™s lean manufacturing process. In Kanban, tasks are represented as cards on a board divided into sections that correspond to different stages of execution.

In **ERPZ**, the **Kanban View** is rendered based on task status. You can update the status of a task by moving its card from one column to the next. You can also assign colors to these columns for visual reference.

### 3. List View

The **List View** provides a straightforward way to see all tasks associated with a project. This view displays tasks in a table format, allowing users to quickly assess task details such as task names, statuses, assignees, due dates, and priority levels.

You can filter, sort, and search through tasks in this view, making it easy to find specific tasks and manage them efficiently.
