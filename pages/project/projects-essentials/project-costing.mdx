## Project Costing

Each project has multiple tasks associated with it. To track the actual cost of a project, primarily in terms of services, a user has to create a timesheet based on the time spent on a task within a project. You can track the service cost against a project in the following ways.

### 1. Activity Type

**Activity Type** is a master of services offered by your personnel. You can add a new Activity Type from:

**Home > Projects > Activity Type > New**

### 2. Activity Cost

**Activity Cost** is a master where you can track billing and costing rates for each employee, for each activity type.

### 3. Timesheet

Based on the time spent on the project task, an employee will create a timesheet.

On selecting the **Activity Type** in the time log, billing and costing rates will be fetched for that employee from the respective **Activity Cost**.

Multiplying these rates with the total number of hours in the time log gives the **Costing Amount** and **Billing Amount** for the specific time log.

### 4. Costing in Project and Task

Based on all the timesheets created for specific tasks, their costing will be updated in the respective task.

In the same way, the project cost will be updated based on timesheets created against each of its associated tasks, and the cost of the project gets updated simultaneously.
