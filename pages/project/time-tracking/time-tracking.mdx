## Time Tracking

Project time tracking in **ERPZ** plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate project management and optimal resource utilization.

By allowing employees to log time against specific tasks or projects, **ERPZ** provides clear visibility into the time spent on various activities. This feature aids in monitoring project progress, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing resource allocation. Time tracking within the project management module empowers project managers to make informed decisions based on real-time data, ultimately leading to more efficient project execution and successful outcomes.

### 1. [Activity Type](/project/time-tracking/activity-type)

In **ERPZ**, **Activity Types** are essential for categorizing the different services offered by your team. Each activity type can be linked to specific tasks or projects, helping in tracking and analyzing time spent on various activities. You can add a new Activity Type by navigating to:

`Home > Projects > Activity Type > New`


### 2. [Activity Cost](/project/time-tracking/activity-cost)

**Activity Cost** refers to the master data where you can track the billing and costing rates for each employee related to each Activity Type. This allows for accurate financial planning and analysis of project costs based on the activities being performed. Proper management of Activity Costs is crucial for maintaining budget integrity and ensuring profitability.

### 3. [Timesheets](/project/time-tracking/timesheets)

Employees can create **Timesheets** based on the time spent on specific tasks within a project. The timesheet captures the hours logged against each task, allowing for detailed tracking of effort and resource allocation.

When logging time, selecting the appropriate **Activity Type** will automatically fetch the billing and costing rates for the respective employee from the Activity Cost data. Multiplying these rates by the total number of hours logged in the Timesheet gives the **Costing Amount** and **Billing Amount** for each entry.

This structured approach to time tracking helps in maintaining comprehensive records, facilitating better project management, and ensuring the profitability of projects.
