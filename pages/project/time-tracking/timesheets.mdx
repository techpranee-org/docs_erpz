# Timesheet

**A Timesheet is the record of the number of hours spent by an employee on completion of each task.**

The Timesheet can also be used to calculate billable hours for an employee, determine their salaries, or track their contributions toward a Project or a Task.

In ERPZ, a Timesheet can account for a particular employee working on multiple Tasks or Projects in a tabular format.

## To access Timesheet:

Navigate to:

`Home > Projects > Time Tracking > Timesheet`

## 1. How to Create a Timesheet

To create a new Timesheet, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Timesheet** list and click on **New**.
2. Enter the **Company name** and the **Employee Code**.
3. Add the following details to the field **Time Sheets**:
   - **Activity Type**: Add the type of activity for which the Timesheet has been created.
   - **From Time**: Enter the date and time at which the work started.
   - **Hrs**: Enter the number of hours for which this Timesheet has been created. A single Timesheet can track work hours over multiple days.
   - **Project**: If this Timesheet needs to be tagged to a particular Project, you can add the name of the Project here.
   - **Bill**: Check this box if this Timesheet is billable.
4. Click on **Add Row** to add more such Time Sheets.
5. Save the Timesheet.

After saving, the system will automatically update the **Start Date**, **End Date**, and **Total Working Hours** based on the details entered. Click **Submit** to finalize.

### 1.1. Creating a Timesheet from a Task

Alternatively, a Timesheet can be created from a Task as follows:

2. Navigate to **Timesheet** under the Activity section on the Dashboard. Click the plus icon **(+)** to be redirected to the Timesheet creation page.
3. Follow the steps to create a Timesheet.

### 1.2. Timer in Timesheet

**A Timer can be used to record the actual time taken by an employee to finish a particular activity in a Timesheet.**

#### Steps to Start a Timer:

1. In a Timesheet, click on **Start Timer**. A dialog box will pop up asking for the following details:
   - **Activity Type**: The Activity for which you are recording the Time.
   - **Project**: The Project associated with the Timesheet.
   - **Task**: The Task for which you are recording time.
   - **Expected Hrs**: Enter the anticipated time required to complete the Task.

**Once you have completed the Task, click on Complete.** A new entry will be created in the Timesheet, recording the time spent.

If the time exceeds the **Expected Hrs**, an alert box will appear.

### 1.3. Additional Options while Creating the Timesheet

When expanded, the Timesheet allows you to enter the following additional details:
