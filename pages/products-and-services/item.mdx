# How to Create a Product in ERPZ

In ERPZ, products can either be physical items or services. 

The term product is also applicable to raw materials or components of products yet to be produced (before they can be sold to customers). ERPZ allows you to manage all sorts of products like raw-materials, sub-assemblies, finished goods, item variants, and service items.

ERPZ is optimized for itemized management of your sales and purchase. If you are in services, you can create an product for each service that you offer. Completing the Product Master is very essential for the successful implementation of ERPZ.

To create a new product, follow the steps below:

## 1. Navigate to Products
From the dashboard, click on the **Products**.
