# ERPZ Search with "Add New" Functionality

In ERPZ, when users search for a product, category, or any other entity, they can quickly add missing options directly from the search interface. If no matching options are available, users can click on **left arrow** to open a form to add the new item from the search dropdown. This feature supports various entities like products, categories, workspaces, warehouses, and more.

## Feature Overview

1. **Search and Dropdown Suggestions**
   - Users can search for existing options in ERPZ, such as products or categories, using a search bar.
   - As they type, relevant suggestions appear in a dropdown list below the search input.
   - The dropdown provides a seamless way to navigate existing options quickly.

2. **"Add New" Trigger for Missing Options**
   - If no matching options are found, a prompt will appear at the bottom of the dropdown.
   - A **left arrow icon** on the right side of the dropdown will appear, labeled as an "+ Add" option.
   - Clicking this arrow icon will initiate the "Add New" process.

3. **Right-Side Drawer with Dynamic Form**
   - When the "Add New" option is selected, a form slides out from the right side of the screen in a drawer.
   - This form is dynamically generated based on the item type the user is attempting to add, whether it's a product, category, workspace, or warehouse.
   - The form includes all necessary fields relevant to the chosen entity, and validations ensure that required information is provided.

4. **Saving and Updating the Dropdown**
   - After filling in the form, users can submit it to add the new item.
   - Once the submission is successful, the dropdown is updated in real time to include the newly added option, allowing users to proceed immediately.
   - A success message is displayed, and the drawer automatically closes.
