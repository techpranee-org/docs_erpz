# Status Field Options in ERPZ

The **Status** field in ERPZ is used across multiple forms, including **Purchase Requests**, **Material Requests**, and other procurement or inventory management forms. Each status option represents a different stage in the process, providing clear visibility and tracking for various requests.

## Status Options

- **Draft**:  
  The initial stage of a request. In the Draft status, the form can be modified, allowing users to add or adjust details as needed. The request is not yet finalized or ready for approval.

- **Sent**:  
  Indicates that the request has been forwarded to the relevant team or department for review. At this stage, the request is awaiting further action or confirmation.

- **Processing**:  
  Once the request is approved and active steps are being taken to fulfill it, the status moves to Processing. This means that tasks like ordering items or coordinating with suppliers are underway.

- **Cancelled**:  
  If a request is no longer required or was created by mistake, it can be marked as Cancelled. This status confirms that the request will not proceed further and is effectively closed.

- **Completed**:  
  The request has been fulfilled entirely. All required actions, such as purchasing, receiving items, or completing tasks, have been finished. This status confirms that the request process is concluded.

These status options provide users with an easy way to track the progression of various requests within ERPZ, ensuring transparency and efficient workflow management across different modules.
