# Customer Group

**Customer Group is an aggregation of customers that are similar in some way.**

Customer groups allow you to organize your customers effectively. Typically, customers are grouped by market segment based on the domain in which a business operates. Customer Groups are created hierarchically in ERPZ, allowing you to create a main customer group and add sub-groups under it.

You can define a price list that will be automatically applied to all customers belonging to that group. Additionally, you can perform trend analysis for each group. Default customer groups include Individual, Commercial, and Government, but you can add your own groups based on your requirements, such as Retail or Wholesale.

## 1. How to Create a Customer Group

1. Go to **CRM > Settings > Customer Group**.
2. Click on a parent customer group, such as 'All Customer Groups'.
3. Click on 'Add Child'.
4. Enter the **Customer Group Name**.
5. Tick 'Group Node' if you would like to add sub-customer groups under this.
6. Click on 'Create New'.

**Tip**: If you find the process overwhelming, you can leave it at the “Default Customer Group.” However, investing the effort into organizing your customer groups will pay off when you start receiving insightful reports. An example of a sample report is given below:

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Assign Credit Limit, Default Price List, and Default Payment Terms Template

You can assign a credit limit, price list, and payment terms to the customer group. These settings will automatically apply when a customer belonging to the group is selected in sales transactions like Sales Orders and Sales Invoices.

### 2.2 Default Receivable Account

In ERPZ, you do not need to create a separate accounting ledger for each customer. If a separate receivable account is required for a customer, you can add it in the 'Default Receivable Account' section.
