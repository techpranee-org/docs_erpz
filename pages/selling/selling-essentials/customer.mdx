## Customer

A customer, often referred to as a client, buyer, or purchaser, is an individual or organization that receives goods, services, products, or ideas from a seller in exchange for monetary consideration.

### 1. Creating a Customer

Each customer must be assigned a unique ID. You can either use the customer name as the ID or set a naming series for IDs to be generated in the Selling Settings.

To access the Customer list, navigate to:

- `Home > CRM > Sales Pipeline`
- `Home > Selling > Customers`

### 2. How to Create a Customer

1. Go to the Customer list and click on **New**.
2. Enter the full name of the customer.
3. Select **Individual** if the customer represents a person, or **Company** if it represents a business in the **Type** field.
4. Choose a **Customer Group**. Default options include Individual, Commercial, Non-Profit, and Government. You can create additional groups if needed.
5. Select the **Territory**.
6. If creating the customer from a lead, select the lead in the **From Lead** field.
7. Click **Save**.

You can disable sales orders and sales invoices for a customer by clicking on **Disabled**.

### 3. Advanced Tip
If the customer represents one of your own companies, check the **Is Internal Customer** box. For more information, see **Inter Company Invoices**.

You can also upload customer details using the **Data Import Tool**.

### 4. Features

#### General Flow of Transactions
The general flow of transactions for a customer is as follows:

    A[Customer] --> B[Opportunity]
    A[Customer] --> C[Quotation]
    B --> D[Sales Order]
    C --> D[Sales Order]
    D --> E[Delivery Note]
    E --> F[Sales Invoice]
    F --> G[Payment Entry]
    ```

**Note**: Customers are distinct from Contacts and Addresses. A customer can have multiple contacts and addresses.

#### 1. Multiple Contacts and Addresses
Contacts and addresses are stored separately, allowing you to attach multiple contacts or addresses to a customer.

#### 2. Allow Creation of Sales Invoice Without Sales Order and Delivery Note
If the "Delivery Note Required" or "Sales Order Required" option is set to "Yes" in Selling Settings, it can be overridden for a specific customer by enabling the "Allow Sales Invoice Creation Without Sales Order" or "Allow Sales Invoice Creation Without Delivery Note" option in the Customer Master.

#### 3. Set Tax Withholding Category
You can set the **Tax Withholding Category** to set up Tax Collected at Source (TCS) against eligible customers. For more details, visit the **Tax Withholding Category** page.

#### 4. Default Currency and Price List
ERPZ supports multiple currencies and price lists. You can select the default billing currency and price list for the customer in sales orders and invoices.

#### 5. Integration with Accounts
Unlike many accounting software, you do not need to create a separate accounting ledger for each customer. A unified ledger named **Debtors** is created by default. If a separate ledger is needed, create it under **Accounts Receivable** in the Chart of Accounts and add it in the **ACCOUNTING** section of the customer.

**Advanced Tip**: ERPZ supports multi-company accounting. You can use the same customer records across multiple companies, but ensure to select the company and corresponding ledger if you require a separate accounting ledger.

#### 6. Credit Limit and Payment Terms
Set the credit limit by entering an amount in the **Credit Limit** field. You can also select the default payment terms to be applied in sales orders and invoices in the **Default Payment Terms Template** field.

#### 7. Sales Team and Sales Partner
You can add salespersons to manage sales to the customer in the **SALES TEAM** section. If multiple salespersons are involved, you can split the contribution among them, ensuring the total equals 100%.

A **Sales Partner** is a third-party distributor or reseller. If products/services are sold to the customer through a sales partner, set it in the **Sales Partner** field and mention the **Commission Rate** for commission calculations.

#### 8. Loyalty Program
If you want to offer a loyalty program to the customer, select the appropriate program in the **Loyalty Program** field.

#### 9. View Accounting Ledger and Accounts Receivable
- Click on the **Accounting Ledger** button to view all accounting transactions with the customer.
- Click on the **Accounts Receivable** button to view outstanding invoices.

#### 10. Set Customer ID, Default Customer Group, Territory, and Price List
You can set how a unique ID is generated for each customer in Selling Settings.

- **Naming Series**: Choose 'Naming Series' if you want a unique ID generated based on the naming series.
- **Customer Name**: Select 'Customer Name' if the customer name itself should be used as the ID. If duplicate names exist, a suffix will be added to differentiate.

You can set the default customer group, territory, and price list in Selling Settings.

You can also customize the **Customer** DocType using the **Customize Form** tool.
