# POS Invoice Consolidation

In ERPZ, the **POS Invoice Consolidation** feature helps improve the efficiency and speed of the Point of Sale system by deferring stock and accounting updates until the end of a POS session. Here's how it works:

## 1. Key Points of POS Consolidation

- **Intermediate Invoices**: Each transaction during a POS session creates an intermediate invoice, also called a **POS Invoice**, which does not immediately affect stock and accounting ledgers. This helps maintain speed during the transaction.
  
- **Sub-Ledger System**: The POS uses a sub-ledger, separate from the general ledger, to manage the transactions. This keeps the system scalable by reducing the load on the main accounting system.
  
- **End-of-Day Consolidation**: At the end of a POS session, when a **POS Closing Voucher** is submitted, all intermediate invoices are merged into a single consolidated **Sales Invoice**. This invoice updates the stock and accounting ledgers.

## 2. Impact on Stock and Accounting

With POS Invoice Consolidation, the system reduces the number of ledger entries. Instead of creating multiple entries for each transaction, a single consolidated sales invoice will be created, minimizing the workload on the general ledger. This improves the speed and performance of the system.

For example, in older systems, **n x 3 ledger entries** were created, where `n` is the number of transactions. In ERPZ, the consolidated invoice only creates a few entries, significantly reducing the strain on the ledger.

## 3. Tracking Stock During Active POS Sessions

While stock entries arenâ€™t immediately updated in the **Stock Ledger**, the system tracks reserved quantities in real time through the **Stock Projected Quantity Report**:

- `Stock > Stock Reports > Stock Projected Quantity`

In the report, the **Actual Qty** column represents the stock ledger value, while the **Reserved for POS Transactions** column shows the quantities reserved for active POS sessions. The **Projected Qty** shows the available stock after subtracting reserved quantities from the actual stock.

For example, if there is an open order for 100 units, the system will reflect the order in the **Projected Qty**, but the **Actual Qty** will remain unchanged until the stock is received.

## 4. Available Quantity at the Warehouse

When processing transactions in the POS, the system ensures that sufficient stock is available. If stock is insufficient (as shown in the **Available Qty at Warehouse** field), the transaction will not be permitted. This applies to all active POS sessions across the organization, ensuring that stock levels are accurate across multiple locations.

In cases where an item is unavailable, the POS will block the transaction until enough stock is added to the warehouse.
