# Point of Sale (POS)

**The Point of Sale (POS) in ERPZ allows retail businesses to streamline their sales transactions, inventory management, and customer interactions.** It ensures that the sale, payment, and inventory updates happen seamlessly during a retail transaction.

To access the POS feature, navigate to:

`Home > Retail > Retail Operations > Point-of-Sale (POS)`

## 1. Prerequisites

Before using the Point of Sale feature, make sure the following are set up:

- POS Profile
- Price Lists
- Warehouses with stock availability

## 2. Creating a POS Invoice

Once the POS profile is configured, you can start processing sales at the POS counter. Here's how to create a POS Invoice:

### 2.1 Steps:

1. Go to **POS** and select a **Customer**.
2. Add **Items** to the cart by selecting them from the displayed list.
3. Verify the **Selling Price** of the items from the Price List.
4. Adjust the **Quantities** and optionally modify the **Rate** or **Discount** if enabled in the POS Profile.
5. Ensure that a **Warehouse** is selected. If set in both the POS Profile and the Item, the one in the POS Profile will be prioritized.
6. After verifying the **Net** and **Grand Total**, proceed with payment.
7. Select the appropriate **Payment Mode** and click **Complete Order** to generate the invoice.
8. You can print the invoice or email it to the customer directly after the invoice is submitted.

To remove an item from the cart:

- Set the **Quantity** to zero using the minus button or manually set the quantity to zero.
