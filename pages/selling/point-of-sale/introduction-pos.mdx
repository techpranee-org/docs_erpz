# Point of Sale (POS)

The **Point of Sale (POS)** module in ERPZ offers a streamlined solution for managing retail transactions efficiently. It seamlessly integrates with inventory management, updating stock levels in real-time and preventing stock discrepancies. ERPZ's POS also supports multiple payment methods, streamlining the payment process for customers and reducing transaction errors.

With built-in reporting and analytics, businesses can gain valuable insights into sales performance, top-selling items, and customer trends, helping them make informed decisions to improve overall efficiency and profitability in their retail operations.

## Key Features of POS in ERPZ

### 1. [POS Profile](/selling/point-of-sale/pos-profile)
The **POS Profile** allows businesses to set up configurations for their specific retail locations, including warehouse, pricing rules, tax templates, and payment methods. This ensures that each transaction follows predefined rules, making the process smooth and error-free.

### 2. [Point of Sale Interface](/selling/point-of-sale/point-of-sales)
The **Point of Sale** interface is designed for quick and easy use by retail staff, with an intuitive layout that minimizes errors and maximizes efficiency. The system allows for real-time synchronization with the backend, ensuring that stock levels are always accurate.

### 3. POS Opening Entry
A **POS Opening Entry** records the initial cash or payment float available at the start of a day or shift. This helps in tracking the cash movements and preventing any discrepancies during the day.

### 4. POS Closing Entry
At the end of each shift or business day, a **POS Closing Entry** is created to track the cash or payments collected. This closing entry is matched against the opening entry to ensure that all payments and cash transactions have been accounted for.

### 5. [POS Invoice Consolidation](/selling/point-of-sale/pos-invoice-consolidation)
