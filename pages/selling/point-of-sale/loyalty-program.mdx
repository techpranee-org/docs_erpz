# Loyalty Program

A **Loyalty Program** in ERPZ allows customers to earn points by spending a certain amount, which they can redeem for future purchases.

A **Customer Loyalty Program** is a structured marketing initiative designed to incentivize repeat customers. These programs motivate customers to make frequent purchases, helping businesses retain customers and boost loyalty.

To access the Loyalty Program list, navigate to:

`Home > Retail > Retail Operations > Loyalty Program`

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating a Loyalty Program, ensure the following are created:

- **Customer**
- **Sales Invoice**

## 2. How to Create a Loyalty Program

To create a new Loyalty Program, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Loyalty Program list and click **New**.
2. Enter a **Name** for the program.
3. Select whether the program is **Single Tiered** or **Multi-Tiered** (e.g., Gold, Silver).
4. Set a **Start Date** and **End Date** for the program.
5. Choose the **Customer Group** and **Territory** to which the program applies. By default, it applies to all.
6. Enable **Auto Opt-In (For all customers)** to include all customers automatically. If not selected, you can assign the program through the Customer master.
7. In the table, specify:
   - **Tier Name**: The name of the tier based on customer eligibility.
   - **Collection Factor**: The amount a customer needs to spend to earn 1 Loyalty Point.
   - **Minimum Amount**: The minimum amount required to qualify for a tier.
   - Set the **Conversion Factor**, e.g., 10 USD = 1 point.

Click **Save** to create the Loyalty Program.

### 2.1 Redemption Section

In the redemption section, configure the following settings:

- **Conversion Factor**: Determines the value of 1 Loyalty Point when redeemed. For example, 1 Loyalty Point = 1 USD.
- **Expense Account**: Specify the Expense Account to track the loyalty points redeemed by customers.
- **Expiry Duration (in days)**: Set the number of days after which the collected loyalty points will expire.

### 2.2 Assigning a Loyalty Program to a Customer

To assign a Loyalty Program to a customer:

1. Go to the **Customer Master** and select a **Loyalty Program** for the customer.
2. The earned loyalty points will be visible in the customerâ€™s dashboard.

### 2.3 Loyalty Point Entry

To view customer loyalty points:

- Navigate to **Accounts > Retail Operations > Loyalty Point Entry** to see how many points each customer has earned and the corresponding sales invoice.

## 3. How Does a Loyalty Program Work?

### 3.1 Earning Points

To set up a Loyalty Program and earn points:

1. Create a **Loyalty Program** as outlined above.
2. Assign the program to a **Customer**.
3. When a Sales Invoice is created for the customer, loyalty points will be awarded according to the program rules. For instance, for an invoice total of 3,000 INR, if the **Collection Factor** is set to 1 point per 300 INR, the customer will earn 15 points.
4. Upon submitting the invoice, a **Loyalty Point Entry** will be generated.

### 3.2 Redeeming Points

To redeem points:

1. Create a new Sales Invoice for the same customer.
2. In the **Loyalty Points** section, enable the **Redeem Loyalty Points** option.
3. The fields for **Loyalty Point**, **Redemption Account**, and **Redemption Cost Center** will become visible, fetched from the assigned Loyalty Program.
4. Enter the number of points to redeem. If the customer attempts to redeem more points than available, an error will occur.
5. Submit the invoice to finalize the redemption. Two **Loyalty Point Entries** will be created: one for the points redeemed and one for the current invoice.

> **Note**: If a return invoice is created for an invoice on which points were earned, the original Loyalty Point Entry will be adjusted, and a new one will be created to reflect the return.
