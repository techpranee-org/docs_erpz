# Sales Reports

ERPZ offers various reports to track and analyze your companyâ€™s sales performance. You can gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and overall sales health using different filters and views. The reports are designed to provide detailed, customizable data visualization and analysis, which can be accessed through:

**Home > Selling > Key Reports**

## 1. Sales Analytics Report

Navigate to **Selling > Analytics > Sales Analytics**. This report allows you to view and analyze sales data through multiple lenses, including date ranges, customers, and products.

### 1.1 Sales Analytics Sections
The Sales Analytics Report is divided into three main sections:
- **Filter Toolbar**: Customize the data you want to analyze by applying filters such as date, territory, customer type, etc.
- **Graph Window**: Visualize the filtered data using customizable graphs and charts.
- **Data Window**: View detailed data records. You can drill down or expand data to see summaries or granular details of your sales performance.

### 1.2 Sales Analytics Filters
Use the filter toolbar to refine the data displayed. Options include date ranges, product categories, customer segments, and more. Any changes you make in the filter toolbar will be instantly reflected in the data and graph windows, giving you real-time analysis.

### 1.3 Data Window Customization
You can collapse or expand specific data sections for deeper analysis. Comparison of data between different levels (such as comparing a specific item to its category) is possible without restrictions.

### 1.4 Chart Customization
By clicking the **Set Chart** button, you can set values for the X and Y axes, choose different chart types (bar, line, pie charts, etc.), and even customize colors to match your preferences.

## 2. Sales Funnel Report

Go to **Selling > Analytics > Sales Funnel** to gain insights into your sales pipeline. This report helps visualize the progression of leads through the sales process, broken down into four key stages:

- **Active Leads**: Displays the total number of active leads, including those at various stages of the sales funnel.
- **Opportunities**: Shows leads that have been converted into opportunities, representing potential sales.
- **Quotations**: Indicates how many opportunities have received quotations.
- **Converted**: Represents the number of leads that have resulted in sales orders after a quotation was submitted.

The sales funnel offers a clear view of where leads are in the pipeline and helps you identify areas where leads may be getting stuck or lost.

## 3. Customer Acquisition and Loyalty Report

Access this report under **Selling > Analytics > Customer Acquisition and Loyalty** to get a deeper understanding of how new and returning customers contribute to your revenue.

### 3.1 Filter and Data Windows
You can apply filters such as company and date ranges to customize the report. The Data Window will automatically update to reflect these changes.

### 3.2 Data Window Features
In the data window, you can:
- **Move Columns**: Drag and drop columns to rearrange the data as needed.
- **Sort Data**: Sort columns in ascending or descending order by clicking the column headings.
- **Apply Filters**: Use the filter boxes below column headings to quickly find and display specific records.

This report helps you assess customer loyalty and acquisition by providing insights into the ratio of new to existing customers, as well as their respective contributions to overall sales.
