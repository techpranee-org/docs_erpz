# Credit Note

**A Credit Note is a document sent by a seller to the Customer, notifying that a credit has been made to their account against the goods returned by the buyer.**

A Credit Note is issued for the value of goods returned by the Customer, and it may be less than or equal to the total amount of the order.

## 1. How to make a Credit Note

You can make a Credit Note against a Sales Invoice, or you can create a Credit Note directly from the Sales Invoice without a reference. Note that to create a Credit Note, the invoice must have been paid using a Payment Entry.

To create a Credit Note:

1. Go to the respective Sales Invoice.
2. Click on **Create > Return / Credit Note**.

The Customer and Item details will be fetched from the Sales Invoice.

- If the Customer had paid partially or fully, you should make a Payment Entry against the original Sales Invoice.
- Save and Submit.

The Item quantity and Payment amount will be negative since it's a return.

### 1.1 How does a Credit Note affect the ledger?

Once a Payment Entry is created against the original Sales Invoice, the amount will be added to the Customer's account in negative. The next time they make a purchase, this amount will be adjusted against the new purchase.

Here is how the ledger is affected after a payment entry against a returned invoice:

Credit Note Ledger Example:

- The amount credited will appear as a negative entry in the Customer's account, and it will be adjusted in future purchases.

Refer to the [Sales Invoice](#) page for further details.

### 1.2 No payment was made against the Sales Invoice

If **no payment** was made against the original invoice, you can simply cancel the Sales Invoice. However, if only part of the Items (e.g., 5 out of 10) is being returned from an invoice, creating a Credit Note is useful for updating the ledger correctly.

## 2. Example

**Example:**

Customer Rohan had purchased PVC pipes worth Rs 300 + taxes. At the time of delivery, Rohan found that the products were damaged. Rohan has returned the product, and a Credit Note will be issued.

The Credit Note with a payment entry for the above example in ERPZ would look like this:

1. Rohan's purchase will have a Sales Invoice for Rs 300.
2. A Credit Note will be issued for the returned products, and the Payment Entry will reflect the negative adjustment.
