# Selling Transactions

Selling transactions in ERPZ include all the essential steps of the sales process, from generating quotations to delivering products or services and collecting payments. ERPZ enables businesses to manage their sales workflow efficiently, ensuring smooth interaction with customers, accurate tracking of sales, and real-time inventory updates. These transactions are also integrated with the accounting module to maintain precise financial records.

## Key Selling Transactions in ERPZ

### 1. Quotation
A **Quotation** is a formal offer made to a customer for products or services. It outlines the prices, quantities, and terms of sale, and serves as the basis for negotiations before finalizing an order.

### 2. Sales Order
A **Sales Order** confirms a customer's intent to purchase. It helps track the order details, including items, quantities, and delivery schedules. Sales orders also help update inventory and initiate the fulfillment process.

### 3. Sales Invoice
The **Sales Invoice** is a document sent to the customer requesting payment for the products or services provided. It includes details about the sale, such as the products sold, the prices, and any applicable taxes or discounts.

### 4. Credit Note
A **Credit Note** is issued to customers for various reasons, such as returning goods, offering refunds, or adjusting incorrect invoices. It is a key part of managing customer relationships and refund processes.

### 5. Blanket Order
A **Blanket Order** allows businesses to lock in terms and prices with a customer for multiple transactions over a period of time. It helps manage bulk or recurring orders without needing to create a new sales order for every purchase.

### 6. Drop Shipping
**Drop Shipping** in ERPZ allows businesses to process orders where the supplier directly ships the products to the customer, reducing handling and inventory management for the seller.

### 7. Sales Return
A **Sales Return** is the process where a customer returns goods that were previously sold. ERPZ helps manage returns efficiently by adjusting inventory and customer accounts accordingly.

### 8. Delivery Note
A **Delivery Note** is issued when goods are shipped to the customer. It serves as proof of delivery and ensures the customer receives the correct products in the right quantities.
