# Sales Order

**A Sales Order is a confirmation of an order from your customer.**

It is usually a binding contract with your customer. Once your customer confirms the Quotation, you can convert your Quotation into a Sales Order.

## Sales Flow

To access Sales Order, go to:

`Home > Selling > Sales > Sales Order`

### 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and using a Sales Order, it is advised that you create the following first:

- Customer
- Item

### 2. How to create a Sales Order

1. Go to the Sales Order list, click on New.
2. Select the Customer.
3. Set the 'Delivery Date' - applied to the whole order.
4. With Order Type, you can set whether it's a Sales order, Maintenance order, or from the online Shopping Cart of your website. By default, this value is set to "Sales".
5. In the "Customer's Purchase Order" field, enter the Customers Purchase Order No. or other useful reference details.
6. Enter the items and quantities to be delivered in the Item table. If Item Prices are set for the items, the Rate field will be populated automatically. If not, enter the item Rate manually.
7. Click **Save** to save a draft of the Sales Order.
8. **Submit** to submit the Sales Order to the System.

#### 2.1 Other ways to create a Sales Order

You can also create a Sales Order from a submitted Quotation via the Create button on the top right.

To allow for per-Customer, per-Item Pricing Rules, ("Customer A" pays $1.00 for "Item 1" but "Customer B" pays $1.25 for "Item 1"), enable 'Allow User to Edit Price List Rate in Transaction' in Selling Settings.
