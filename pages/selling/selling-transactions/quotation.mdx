# Quotation

A **quotation** is an estimated cost of the products/services you're selling to your future or present customer.

During a sale, a customer may request a note about the products or services you are planning to offer, along with the prices and other terms of engagement. This document is commonly referred to as a **Proposal**, **Estimate**, **Pro Forma Invoice**, or **Quotation**.

To access the Quotation list in ERPZ, navigate to:

> **Home > Selling > Sales > Quotation**

A typical sales flow starts with making a quotation from an opportunity.

## What a Quotation Contains

A quotation in ERPZ includes the following details:

- The recipient of the Quotation
- The Items and quantities offered
- The rates at which the items are offered
- Applicable taxes
- Other charges (like shipping, insurance) if applicable
- The validity of the contract
- The time of delivery
- Other terms and conditions

> **Tip:** Images enhance the presentation of your quotations. Make sure your items have an image attached.
