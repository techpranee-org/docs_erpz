# Fiscal Year

A **Fiscal Year** is used to record and report financial transactions for a specific year.

Also known as a financial year or budget year, the Fiscal Year is critical for calculating financial statements in businesses and other organizations. The Fiscal Year may or may not align with the calendar year, depending on the company's preferences or regulatory requirements.

For tax purposes, businesses can choose to follow either a **calendar year** (January 1 to December 31) or a **fiscal year** (which could start on any date) based on jurisdiction. In many regions, laws regarding accounting and taxation require companies to produce financial reports once per twelve months, but the period does not need to follow the calendar year.

A Fiscal Year often starts at the beginning of a quarter, such as April 1, July 1, or October 1. However, many companies choose to align their Fiscal Year with the calendar year for simplicity. In some cases, organizations might benefit from starting their Fiscal Year on a different date, especially if their operations are seasonal.

For example, businesses that experience seasonal fluctuations might start their Fiscal Year on July 1 or October 1. A company with most of its income in the fall and expenses in the spring might choose October 1 to align their financial planning with the flow of their business cycle. This allows them to adjust their expenses to meet their desired profit margins.
