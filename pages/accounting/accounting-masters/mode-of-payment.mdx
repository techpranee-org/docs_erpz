# Mode of Payment

The **Mode of Payment** defines the medium through which payments are made or received in ERPZ.

To access the Mode of Payment list, navigate to:

`Home > Accounting > Settings > Mode of Payment`

## 1. How to Create a Mode of Payment

1. Go to the Mode of Payment list and click on **New**.
2. Enter a name for the Mode of Payment.
3. Select a type: **Cash**, **Bank**, or **General**. This categorization is useful for tracking the mode of payment used in Point Of Sales (PoS).
4. Set a default payment account applicable to all companies.
5. Save the new entry.

**Tip:** Setting a default account ensures that this account is automatically fetched into Payment Entries.

**Note:** When creating Payment Entries, the default bank account will be fetched in the following order if set:

- Company form
- Mode of Payment default account
- Customer/Supplier default bank account
- Manually selected in Payment Entry
