# Chart of Accounts

The **Chart of Accounts** is the blueprint of the accounts in your organization.

The overall structure of your Chart of Accounts in ERPZ is based on a system of **double-entry accounting**, a global standard for quantifying a company's financial status.

It provides a tree view of account names (ledgers and groups) that a company requires to manage its books of accounts. ERPZ sets up a simple chart of accounts for each company, but you can modify it according to your needs and legal requirements.

For each company, the Chart of Accounts helps classify accounting entries, often based on statutory requirements like taxes and compliance with government regulations.

The **Chart of Accounts** helps answer questions such as:

- What is your organization worth?
- How much debt have you taken?
- How much profit are you making (and how much tax will you pay)?
- How much are you selling?
- What is your expense breakdown?

As someone managing a business, this structure helps you gain insights into your business's performance.

> **Tip:** If you're unfamiliar with a balance sheet, it's worth learning. You can also seek help from an accountant to set up your Chart of Accounts.

To access the Chart of Accounts, go to:

**Home > Accounting > Accounting Masters > Chart of Accounts**

## 1. How to Create/Edit Accounts

ERPZ comes with a standard set Chart of Accounts. You can modify this or use the **Chart of Accounts Importer** tool, which will overwrite the existing Chart of Accounts.

To create or edit accounts:

1. Go to the **Chart of Accounts**.
2. Open group accounts to view child accounts or add new ones.
3. Click **Add Child**, **Edit**, or **Delete** for an account.
4. Name the account and assign it a number.
5. Tick 'Is Group' if it is a group account (it can contain other accounts).
6. Select the **Account Type** (important for specific fields).
7. Change the currency if this account will handle transactions in a different currency (by default, it uses the company's currency).
8. Click **Create New**.

### 1.1 Example Accounts:

- **Expenses**: Travel, salaries, telephone.
- **Liabilities**: VAT, sales tax, equity.
- **Income**: Product sales, service sales.
- **Fixed Assets**: Building, machinery, furniture.

> **Tip:** Accounts in different currencies are created when you deal with multiple currencies. For instance, if you're in India and transact with the US, create accounts like 'Debtors US' and 'Creditors US'.

## 2. Account Types

Accounts in ERPZ are classified into **income**, **expense**, **asset**, or **liability** types.

### 2.1 Balance Sheet Accounts

These are the 'Application of Funds (Assets)' and 'Sources of Funds (Liabilities)' that represent the net worth of your company. Assets always equal liabilities, signifying the investments made in the company.

Key accounts include:

- **Assets**: Bank account, land and property, furniture.
- **Liabilities**: Owners' funds, debt, accounts receivable, and accounts payable.

### 2.2 Profit and Loss Accounts

These accounts track income and expenses over a period, representing financial transactions rather than net worth. At the start and end of each fiscal year, Profit and Loss accounts reset to zero.

### 2.3 Groups and Ledgers

- **Groups**: Can have sub-groups and ledgers within them.
- **Ledgers**: Are the final nodes in the chart and cannot contain sub-accounts. Transactions can only be made against ledgers.

> **Info:** The term "Ledger" refers to a page in an accounting book where entries are recorded, often used interchangeably with "Account Head."

## 3. Other Account Types

ERPZ offers various account types, including:

- **Accumulated Depreciation**: Tracks the total depreciation of company assets.
- **Asset Received But Not Billed**: Holds asset value received but not billed.
- **Bank**: Represents bank accounts.
- **Cash**: Represents cash accounts.
- **Cost of Goods Sold**: Accumulates costs for products/services sold.
- **Depreciation**: Books the depreciation of fixed assets.
- **Receivable**: Tracks amounts owed by customers (debtors).
- **Payable**: Tracks amounts owed to suppliers (creditors).
- **Stock Adjustment**: Handles stock/inventory adjustments.

## 4. Financial Statements

In ERPZ, financial statements like the **Balance Sheet**, **Profit and Loss statement**, and **Cash Flow statement** are easily viewable.

### 4.1 Example Financial Statements:

- **Cash Flow Report**
- **Profit and Loss Report**
- **Balance Sheet Report**

## 5. Account Number

Chart of Accounts is usually organized by numerical systems. For example, if assets are classified by numbers starting with 1000, then cash accounts might start with 1100, bank accounts with 1200, etc. Gaps between account numbers allow room for future accounts.

You can assign or update account numbers when creating or editing an account in ERPZ.
