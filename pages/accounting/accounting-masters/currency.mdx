# Currency

In ERPZ, the **Currency** list stores information such as the currency name, symbol, and fractional unit. Most widely-used currencies are already available in ERPZ by default. Exchange rates can be automatically updated based on market rates or set to a fixed rate by manually creating them in the **Currency Exchange** form.

To access the Currency list, navigate to:

`Home > Accounting > Multi Currency > Currency`


For example, the Currency page for Euro (EUR) will display relevant details like its symbol, fractional units, and exchange rate configurations.

## 1. Configurations

Each currency in ERPZ comes with default settings based on globally recognized standards. However, you can modify these settings to fit your specific business needs.

### 1.1 Enable / Disable

By default, only a few popular currencies and the company's default currency are enabled. To enable more currencies, go to the currency list and mark the **Enabled** checkbox for the desired currency.

### 1.2 Fractional Units

Many currencies have fractional units, such as "Cents" for USD or "Paise" for INR. You can configure how these fractional units are displayed and converted when turning amounts into words.

### 1.3 Symbol

Standard currency symbols are pre-populated for each currency, but they can be customized in the **Currency** document if needed.

You can also configure the position of the currency symbol to appear on the right side of the amount by enabling **Show currency symbol on right**. Alternatively, to hide all currency symbols globally, this can be managed in the **Global Defaults**.
