# Finance Book

A **Finance Book** is a ledger where all accounting entries are recorded.

In ERPZ, you can create multiple Finance Books, allowing flexibility in financial reporting. For instance, you might have one Finance Book for tax authorities and another for stakeholders. This feature is especially useful when you need to report depreciation or other values differently due to varying regulatory requirements. It also enables you to maintain alternate balance sheets for internal reports.

Setting up a Finance Book is optional, but if you do create multiple books, you can assign specific entries to each by selecting the appropriate Finance Book in a **Journal Entry**. If the Finance Book field is left blank in a Journal Entry, the entry will be included in all Finance Books by default.

For example, companies often use different depreciation methods like **Straight Line**, **Written Down Value**, or **Double Declining Balance** across different Finance Books. You can set up separate depreciation schedules for each Finance Book in ERPZ, and automatic depreciation entries will be recorded based on those schedules.

## 1. How to Use a Finance Book in ERPZ
