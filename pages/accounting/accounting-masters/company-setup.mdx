# Company Setup

A **Company** in ERPZ represents a legal entity for managing your business operations, whether commercial or industrial. The first company is created during the initial setup of ERPZ, and for each company, you can define its domain (such as manufacturing, retail, or services) based on the type of business activity.

If you need to manage multiple companies, you can add them by navigating to:

**Home > Accounting > Company**

## 1. How to Create a New Company

1. Go to the **Company** list and click **New**.
2. Enter the company name, abbreviation, and default currency.
3. Save the company.

- The **abbreviation** helps distinguish assets, accounts, and documents across different companies. For example, "FT" for Frappe Technologies. The abbreviation will be used in areas such as accounts, cost centers, tax templates, and warehouses.
- You can also upload a company logo and provide a description.

## 1.1 Multi-Company Structure

ERPZ supports the creation of multiple companies. You can set up companies in a parallel structure (sister companies) or a hierarchical structure (parent-child companies). In a **parent-child** structure, the parent company is a larger organization, while the child companies are subsidiaries.

- The **Company Tree** view shows the structure of your companies.
- The system ensures that the accounts of child companies match those of the parent company, which can then be combined into a consolidated chart of accounts.

## 1.2 Other Options When Creating a Company

- **Domain**: Select the domain of the company (e.g., manufacturing, services).
- **Is Group**: If checked, this company is considered a parent company.
- **Parent Company**: If the company is a subsidiary, select its parent company. The chart of accounts will be inherited from the parent company.

## 1.3 Chart of Accounts

Each company in ERPZ has its own **Chart of Accounts** to maintain separate financial records. You can choose from the following options when setting up the chart of accounts:

- **Standard Chart of Accounts**
- **Based on Existing Company's Chart of Accounts**

If a **Parent Company** is selected, the new company’s chart of accounts will inherit the parent company’s chart.

## 1.4 Defaults

You can set default values for key accounts and settings in the Company master, allowing for quicker transaction posting. Defaults include:

- **Default Letterhead**
- **Default Holiday List**
- **Standard Working Hours**
- **Default Terms and Conditions**
- **Country**
- **Tax ID**
- **Date of Establishment**

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Monthly Sales Target

Set a monthly sales target in your company's currency. For example, set a target of $10,000. Once transactions are made, the total monthly sales will be displayed.

### 2.2 Account Settings

Several default accounts are created when setting up a company. These accounts can be customized as needed:

- **Default Bank Account**
- **Default Cash Account**
- **Default Receivable Account**
- **Round Off Account**
- **Discount Allowed/Received Account**
- **Exchange Gain/Loss Account**
- **Default Payable Account**
- **Default Cost of Goods Sold Account**
- **Default Deferred Revenue/Expense Account**
- **Default Payroll Payable Account**
- **Credit Limit**
- **Default Payment Terms Template**

### 2.3 Stock and Manufacturing Settings

The **Perpetual Inventory** feature is enabled by default, meaning stock transactions impact your company's financial books. Additional settings include:

- **Default Inventory Account**
- **Stock Adjustment Account**
- **Stock Received But Not Billed**
- **Expenses Included In Valuation**
- **Manufacturing Overhead Cost Account**: This account tracks operating costs during the manufacturing process.

### 2.4 Fixed Asset Defaults

To manage fixed assets, the following default accounts are set up:

- **Accumulated Depreciation Account**
- **Depreciation Expense Account**
- **Asset Disposal Gain/Loss Account**
- **Capital Work In Progress Account**

### 2.5 HRA Settings

For organizations in India, setting defaults for **Salary Components** like HRA and Basic will help with employee tax declarations.

### 2.6 Bank Remittance Settings

For India-based companies, the **Bank Remittance** feature allows for batch payments to banks. You can enter client and product codes provided by your bank.

### 2.7 Budget

The **Exception Budget Approver Role** allows users with the necessary role to bypass set budgets for approving expenses.

### 2.8 Company Info

Save key details of your company such as:

- Date of Incorporation
- Phone, Fax, and Email
- Website and Address
- Registration Details

For multi-location companies in India, separate addresses can be added for each GSTIN number.

### 2.9 Deleting All Company Transactions

You can delete all transactions (such as orders and invoices) for a company. Use caution as this action cannot be undone. Only a **System Manager** and the **Company Creator** can perform this action.

### 2.10 Changing Parent Company

You can change the parent company of an existing company. Go to the **Parent Company** field, select a new parent company, and save the form.
