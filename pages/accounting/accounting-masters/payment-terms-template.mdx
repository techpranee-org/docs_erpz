# Payment Terms Template

The **Payment Terms Template** allows you to combine multiple payment terms and apply them in transactions easily.

Once created, the Payment Terms Table can be assigned to specific Customers or Suppliers. When you select a Customer or Supplier in a transaction, the corresponding Payment Terms Template will automatically populate the transaction.

**Example:**

If you receive payments in the slabs of 30-70, you can define Payment Terms for each slab, such as 30% and 70%.

In the Payment Terms Template, you can select all the relevant Payment Terms and define a template that can be applied seamlessly in sales and purchase transactions.

## 1. Prerequisites 

Before creating and using a Payment Terms Template, it is advisable to create the following first:

- **Payment Terms**

## 2. How to Create a Payment Terms Template

A Payment Terms Template specifies how ERPZ should populate the table in the 'Payment Terms Schedule' section of sales and purchase documents.

You should use it if you have a set of standard Payment Terms or for ease of use.

1. Go to the Payment Terms Template list and click on **New**.
2. Enter a name for the template.
3. Add the created Payment Terms in the table rows.
4. Ensure that the total Invoice Portion adds up to 100%.
5. Save the template.

## 3. Term-Based Payment Allocation

If the **Allocate Payment Based On Payment Terms** option is enabled on a template, payments made against the invoice through **Create â†’ Payment** will have allocations based on the specified terms.

![Template with 'Allocate Payment Based on Payment Terms' enabled.]()

![Invoice made with the above template.]()

![Payment created against the above invoice.]()
