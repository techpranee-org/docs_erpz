# Types in Tax Template

In ERPZ, the Sales Taxes and Purchase Taxes master include a column called **Type**. This field determines how tax or charge amounts are calculated. Below is an explanation of each type and its use.

---

## 1. Types of Tax Calculation

### 1.1 **Actual**

This option allows you to enter the tax or charge amount directly. For instance, if Rs. 500 is incurred for shipping, you can directly input the amount without any percentage-based calculation.

**Example**: Rs. 500 shipping charge.

---

### 1.2 **On Net Total**

This option is used to apply tax or charges as a percentage of the **Net Total** of the transaction.

**Example**: Applying 18% GST on all items in a Sales Order.

---

### 1.3 **On Previous Row Amount**

This type is used when you want to calculate a tax based on the amount from a previous tax row. It’s particularly useful when secondary taxes are calculated based on the value of a primary tax.

**Example**: Education Cess calculated based on the GST amount.

---

### 1.4 **On Previous Row Total**

For cumulative tax calculations, use this option. It applies the tax on the **Total Amount** of a previous tax row, which includes the Net Total plus the tax from that row.

**Example**: A surcharge calculated on the total GST amount in a previous row.

**Note**: If you select **Previous Row Amount** or **Previous Row Total**, you must specify the **Row No.** from which the amount or total should be used for the calculation.

---

### 1.5 **On Item Quantity**

This type is used when you need to apply a fixed or item-specific tax based on the quantity of items. It’s helpful for taxes or charges that are independent of the item's value.

**Example**: A fixed environmental charge of Rs. 10 per item.

---

## Example Use Case

If you want to apply both GST and a cess based on GST, your tax setup might look like this:

1. **Row 1**: Apply 18% GST **On Net Total**.
2. **Row 2**: Apply 2% Education Cess **On Previous Row Amount** (Row 1 for GST).
