# Tax Category

A Tax Category allows the application of one or more Tax Rules to transactions based on various criteria.

If you want to apply different kinds of taxes based on Tax Categories, create Tax Categories from:

`Home > Accounting > Taxes > Tax Category`

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and using a Tax Category, it is advised to create the following first:

- **Tax Rule**

## 2. How Does a Tax Category Work?

Creating a Tax Category is simple. Go to the Tax Category list, click on **New**, and enter a name.

- A Tax Category can be linked to one or more Tax Rules.
- This Tax Category can be assigned to a Customer, so when that Customer is selected, the Tax Category will be fetched. The same applies to Suppliers.
- This setup will fetch the Sales Tax Template linked to the Tax Rule, automatically filling the rows in the Tax table.
- Tax Categories can be used to group Customers to whom the same tax will be applied, such as Government, NGOs, or commercial entities.

### Tax Category in Sales Invoice

**Tip:** One Tax Category can be assigned to multiple Tax Rules. This flexibility allows you to create different combinations to apply taxes automatically to transactions.

## 3. Assigning Tax Category

The Tax Category is automatically determined in a transaction by either the Party Address or Party Master (Customer/Supplier). You can assign Tax Categories based on:

- **Customer**
- **Supplier**
- **Address**: Billing or Shipping. You can select whether the Billing Address or Shipping Address gets preference by changing the 'Determine Address Tax Category From' option in Accounts Settings. The Tax Category is determined from the Party Address first. If the Address is not assigned any Tax Category, then the Party's Tax Category is used.

- **Item**: You can also manually select the Tax Category in a transaction.

## 4. What Effect Does the Tax Category Have in a Transaction?

- Specific Item Tax Templates for that Tax Category are automatically set for items.
- You can create Tax Rules to automatically set a specific Sales/Purchase Taxes and Charges Template based on different Tax Categories in transactions.
