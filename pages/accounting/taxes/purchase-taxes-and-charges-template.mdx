# Purchase Taxes and Charges Template

Purchase Taxes and Charges can be applied to any item you buy in ERPZ.

The Purchase Taxes and Charges Template is similar to the Sales Taxes and Charges Template. The templates created from this form can be used in Purchase Orders and Purchase Invoices for internal records. For tax accounts used in these templates, the **Account Type** field must be set as 'Tax' for that particular account.

To access the Purchase Taxes and Charges Template, go to:

`Home > Buying > Settings > Purchase Taxes and Charges Template`


## 1. How to Add Purchase Taxes/Charges via a Template

Before creating a new template, note that templates for many commonly used taxes are already available.

1. Click on **New**.
2. Enter a title for the tax.
3. Under **Type**, set how the tax will be calculated and the tax rate. The following options are available:
   - **Actual**: On the actual amount of each item.
   - **On Net Total**: On the grand total of all items.
   - **On Previous Row Amount**: Use for compounding charges, such as cess on previously taxed amounts.
   - **On Previous Row Total**: Similar to above but applied to the total bill instead of individual items.
4. Select an **Account Head** with preset tax rates or create your own.
5. Select **Default** to apply this template to new purchase transactions automatically.
6. Click **Save**.

> **Note:** For users in India, selecting 'Is Inter State' will adjust taxes based on the GST codes in the place of supply and supplier's shipping address.
