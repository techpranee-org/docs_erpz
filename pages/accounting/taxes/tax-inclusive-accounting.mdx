# Tax Inclusive Accounting

**Use Case**: Tax-inclusive pricing incorporates the sales tax paid by your customer into the itemâ€™s total price, meaning the tax is already included in the final price that the customer sees.

---

### Example:

If an item costs $100 and the tax rate is 10%, the customer still pays $100. In this case, the system will automatically calculate that $9.10 is the tax amount, and the remaining $90.90 is the item's base price.

To configure tax-inclusive accounting in ERPZ, follow these steps:

---

## 1. Steps to Configure Tax-Inclusive Pricing

1. **Go to the Sales Taxes and Charges section** in the relevant transaction.
2. **Expand the row** of the tax you wish to configure by clicking on it.
3. **Check the "Is this Tax included in Basic Rate?"** checkbox.

This setting tells ERPZ that the tax amount is included in the basic price of the item. The system will back-calculate the tax from the total price entered.

## 2. How It Works

When this option is enabled, ERPZ automatically performs the following:

- **Back-calculates the tax amount** from the total price.
- Adjusts the item's base price to reflect the price without tax.
- Ensures that the customer is charged the flat amount you entered, with the tax included in that total.

### Example Calculation:

- **Total Price**: $100
- **Tax Rate**: 10%

ERPZ will calculate the base price and tax as follows:

- **Base Price**: $90.90
- **Tax Amount (10%)**: $9.10
- **Total**: $100
