# Item Tax Template

The **Item Tax Template** is useful for item-wise taxation. If some of your items have tax rates different from the standard tax rate assigned in the Taxes and Charges table, you can create an Item Tax Template and assign it to an Item or Item Group. The rate assigned in the Item Tax Template will take precedence over the standard tax rate assigned in the Taxes and Charges table.

For example, if a tax rate of **GST 18%** is added in the Taxes and Charges table in a Sales Order, it will apply to all items in that Sales Order. However, if you need a different tax rate applied to some items, follow the steps below:

To access the Item Tax Template list, go to:

**Home > Accounting > Taxes > Item Tax Template**

Let's assume that you are creating a Sales Order. You have the Sales Taxes and Charges Template master for **GST 9%**. Out of all the Sales Items, one item may require **5% GST**, while another item may be exempt from tax (non-taxable). You need to select the Account Head for the tax and set its overriding rate.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and using an Item Tax Template, it is advised to create the following first:

- **Item**
- Enable 'Automatically add Taxes and Charges from Item Tax Template' in Account Settings.

## 2. How to Create an Item Tax Template

1. Go to the Item Tax Template list and click on **New**.
2. Enter a title for the Item Tax Template.
3. Select an account and set the overriding rate. Add more rows if required.
4. Save.

Now, the Item Tax Template is ready to be assigned to an Item. To do this, go to the Item, then the Item Tax section, and select an Item Tax Template.

### Note:
It is advised not to use the Sales/Purchase Template selected here in Tax Rules, as it may cause interference. If you want to use the same tax rates for Tax Rules and Item Tax Templates, use a different name for the Sales/Purchase Tax Templates.

### 2.1 Mention Tax Applicable in the Item Master

Tax templates come preset with values. For items with a different tax rate than the others, you need to change it in the Item master. Go to the tax table in the Item, add a row, select the tax type, and change the rate. This new rate will override the template when creating an order/invoice. 

For example, if the tax rate is set as **5**, that's the rate which will be applied in transactions.

- **For an item that is exempt from tax entirely**, mention **0%** as the tax rate in the Item master.

### Note:
For the Item Tax Template to work, ensure that the tax types (accounts) set in the Item Tax Template (with changed tax rates) are present in the Sales Taxes and Charges Template. If you want to include multiple items with different tax rates, you need to record them under different tax heads (e.g., VAT 14%, VAT 5%, etc.).

### 2.2 Tax Calculation in Transactions

In sales transactions like Quotation, Sales Order, and Sales Invoice, the taxes on items are calculated as per the Sales Taxes and Charges Template selected. However, if some items have an Item Tax Template linked, the taxes are calculated on those items as per the rates mentioned in the Item Tax Template instead of the rates mentioned in the Sales Taxes and Charges Template.

For example, in a transaction, taxes may be calculated at **3%** even though the rate as per the Sales Taxes and Charges Template is **6.25%**.

### 2.3 Item Tax Template for Each Item

You can manually select a different Item Tax Template for each Item in a transaction.

### 2.4 Item-wise Tax on an Item Group

You can assign the Item Tax Template to an Item Group by modifying the Item Tax table in the Item Tax section within the Item Group document. 

An Item Tax Template applied to an Item Group will apply to all Items in that group unless an individual Item in the Item Group has its own Item Tax Template assigned to it.

### 2.5 Validity of Item Taxes

You can also assign validity to tax templates based on the posting date of the transaction. A valid tax template will be automatically fetched:

- If there are more than one valid tax templates, the first valid tax template from the Item Tax table will be fetched.
- In case there are no valid tax templates, the first tax template with no 'Valid From' date in the Item Tax table will be fetched.

**Note:** While adding items in a Purchase Invoice, first preference will be given to 'Supplier Invoice Date' instead of 'Posting Date' for fetching the valid Item Tax Template.

### 2.6 Some Points to Note

- If you set the Tax Category as empty, the default Item Tax Template will be applied to Items in transactions.
- You can apply different Item Tax Templates for different Tax Categories.
- For an Item Tax Template to override taxes, there must be a row in the Taxes and Charges table with the same tax Account Head and a standard tax rate.
- If you wish to apply taxes only on the Items with an Item Tax Template, set the standard tax rate as **0**.
