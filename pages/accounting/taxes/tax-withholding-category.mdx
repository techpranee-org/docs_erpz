# Tax Withholding Category

The **Tax Withholding Category** is used to manage **Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)**. It is required when a person responsible for making payments must deduct tax at source at prescribed rates. This ensures tax is collected upfront and deposited with the government.

To access the Tax Withholding Category in ERPZ, go to:
`Home > Accounting > Taxes > Tax Withholding Category`

## 1. Prerequisites

Before setting up a Tax Withholding Category in ERPZ, ensure that the following records have been created:
- **Supplier**
- **Customer**

---

## 2. Creating a Tax Withholding Category

ERPZ comes with default Tax Withholding Categories, but you can create custom ones as needed.

### Steps to create a Tax Withholding Category:
1. Go to **Tax Withholding Category** and click on **New**.
2. Enter a unique **Name** (e.g., Section 194C Individual).
3. Add a **Category Name** (e.g., Dividends, Professional Fees, etc.).
4. Enter the **Tax Withholding Rate** for the relevant **Fiscal Year**.
5. Set a **Threshold** for single invoices or cumulative invoices.
6. Select the **Account** to which tax will be credited.
7. Add multiple companies and their accounts if needed.
8. Click **Save**.

Once saved, assign this category to the relevant **Suppliers**.

### 2.1 Assigning a Tax Withholding Category to a Supplier

After creating the category, you can assign it to suppliers:
- Navigate to the **Supplier** form and assign the appropriate Tax Withholding Category.

---

### 2.2 How does the threshold work?

The threshold determines whether TDS will be applied based on invoice amounts. For instance:
- **Single Threshold**: TDS will be applied when a single invoice crosses this limit.
- **Cumulative Threshold**: TDS will be applied when the total value of all invoices within a period exceeds this threshold.

**Example**: 
- A 5% TDS rate applies if the invoice total exceeds ₹20,000 (Single Threshold) or if the total of multiple invoices exceeds ₹30,000 (Cumulative Threshold).

## 3. Using Tax Withholding in Transactions

### 3.1 Applying TDS in Purchase Invoices

When creating a Purchase Invoice:
- Select the Supplier with the Tax Withholding Category applied.
- Check the "Apply Tax Withholding" option in the invoice to calculate TDS automatically.

### 3.2 Deducting TDS on Advances

#### 3.2.1 TDS Deduction via Purchase Order:
1. Set up the Tax Withholding Category against the supplier.
2. Create a **Purchase Order**, but don't apply TDS at this stage.
3. Make a **Payment Entry** against the Purchase Order, enabling the "Apply Tax Withholding" option.
4. Create a **Purchase Invoice** linked to the Purchase Order. The TDS from the advance will be deducted automatically.

#### 3.2.2 TDS Deduction on Advance Payment:
1. In the **Payment Entry**, select "Pay" under **Payment Type**.
2. Choose **Supplier** as the Party Type.
3. Enter the **Paid Amount** (before TDS deduction).
4. Enable the "Apply Tax Withholding" option, select the relevant Tax Withholding Category, and save the entry.

### 3.3 Setting Up Tax Collection at Source (TCS)

For customers, you can set up TCS for eligible transactions:
1. Create a **Tax Withholding Category** for **TCS - Section 20C(1H)**.
2. Assign this category to customers expected to exceed the TCS threshold (₹50 Lakhs in sales).
3. Create invoices for these customers. When the cumulative threshold is crossed, the TCS will be applied automatically.

---

### 3.4 Advanced Options for Tax Withholding

ERPZ provides advanced features for handling TDS/TCS, including:
- **Consider Entire Party Ledger Amount**: Calculates the cumulative threshold across all transactions for a specific party.
- **Only Deduct Tax on Excess Amount**: Applies tax only to the amount exceeding the threshold.
- **Round Off Tax Amount**: Rounds the calculated tax to the nearest integer.
