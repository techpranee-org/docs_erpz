## 1. How to Import Opening Invoices

1. **Select the Company**: Choose the company for which you want to import opening balances.

2. **Select the Invoice Type**: Choose either **Sales** or **Purchase** to generate the respective Sales Invoices or Purchase Invoices.

3. **Create Missing Party**: Check the "Create Missing Party" checkbox to automatically create customers or suppliers if they do not already exist, based on the names provided in the Party column.

### 1.1 Invoices Table Fields

Fill out the invoices table, which includes the following fields:

- **Party**: Select an existing Customer/Supplier or enter the name of a new one, which will be created automatically.
- **Posting Date**: Specify the date when the invoice will be posted.
- **Due Date**: Indicate the date after which the invoice will be considered overdue.
- **Item Name**: (Optional) Enter the item name to be displayed in the invoice item table.
- **Outstanding Amount**: Enter the outstanding amount of the invoice.
- **Invoice Number**: Provide the corresponding invoice number from the previous system. If left empty, the ERPZ naming series will be used.

### 1.2 Importing via Excel

- **Download Template**: You can click the download button to obtain an Excel sheet, which can be filled out easily with the required data.
- **Upload Data**: Once you have completed the Excel sheet, use the Upload button to upload it back into the tool. This will automatically populate the table with the appropriate data rows.

For detailed instructions and further guidance, refer to the relevant sections in the ERPZ documentation.
