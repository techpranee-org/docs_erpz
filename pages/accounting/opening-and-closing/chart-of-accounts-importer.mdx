## Chart Of Accounts Importer

**Introduced in Version 12**

When a new company is created in ERPZ, the Chart of Accounts is generated by default with a pre-set structure. However, if you have your own Chart of Accounts, you can import it using the Chart of Accounts Importer.

This tool allows you to create your own Chart of Accounts based on your business needs and import it into ERPZ. 

> **Note:** Any existing Chart Of Accounts for the selected company will be overwritten. Ensure that the company does not have any pre-existing transactions, as this will result in a validation error.

To access the Chart of Accounts Importer, go to:

`Home > Getting Started > Chart of Accounts Importer`
