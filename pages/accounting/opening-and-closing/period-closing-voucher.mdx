## Period Closing Voucher

A **Period Closing Voucher** in ERPZ ensures that the profit or loss for a specific accounting period is balanced, allowing the books to start fresh for the next period.

At the end of a fiscal year, quarter, or even month, after completing audits, you can close your books of accounts by making special entries like:

- **Depreciation**
- **Asset Value Adjustments**
- **Deferring Taxes and Liabilities**
- **Bad Debts Adjustment**
- **Booking Profit or Loss**

By doing this, the balances in your Income and Expense Accounts become zero, allowing you to start a new fiscal period with a balanced **Balance Sheet** and fresh **Profit and Loss** account. In ERPZ, after making special entries via **Journal Entry**, the next step is to reset all Income and Expense accounts to zero using the **Period Closing Voucher**.

To access the Period Closing Voucher, go to:

`Home > Accounting > Opening and Closing > Period Closing Voucher`

### 1. How to Create a Period Closing Voucher

1. Go to the **Period Closing Voucher** list and click on **New**.
2. Set a **Posting Date**.
3. Select the account, typically the **Reserves and Surplus** account.
4. Add any necessary remarks.
5. Click **Save** and **Submit**.

### 1.2 The Fields Explained

- **Transaction Date**: The date the Period Closing Voucher is created.
- **Posting Date**: The date when the closing entry should be executed (for example, if the Fiscal Year ends on December 31, select this date as the Posting Date).
- **Closing Fiscal Year**: The fiscal year you are closing.
- **Book Cost Center Wise Profit/Loss**: If enabled, the closing entries will be booked based on the cost center of income and expense transactions.

### 1.3 What Happens After Submission?

Once the Period Closing Voucher is submitted, it will generate accounting entries (GL Entry). This process zeroes out all Income and Expense Accounts, transferring the Profit/Loss balance to the Closing Account.

Typically, a **liability account** such as **Reserves and Surplus**, **Revenue Reserve**, or **Ownerâ€™s Capital** is used as the Closing Account.

If **Book Cost Center Wise Profit/Loss** is enabled, the net profit and loss will be booked by individual cost centers. Below is an example of closing entries made for two sales transactions with different cost centers.

> **Note**: If additional accounting entries are made after the Period Closing Voucher for the closing fiscal year, a new Period Closing Voucher must be created to transfer the remaining Profit/Loss balance into the Closing Account.
