# Journal Entry

A **Journal Entry** is an entry made in the general ledger and it indicates the affected accounts. It is a multi-purpose transaction where the debit and credit accounts can be selected.

All types of accounting entries, other than Sales and Purchase transactions, are made using the Journal Entry. A Journal Entry is a standard accounting transaction that affects multiple accounts, and the sum of debits is equal to the sum of credits. A Journal Entry impacts the main ledger.

Journal Entries can be used for entering expenses, opening entries, contra entries, bank payments, excise entries, etc. For example, booking running expenses, direct expenses like petrol/transport, sundry expenses, adjustment entries, and adjusting invoice amounts.

**Note**: From version-13 onwards, ERPZ introduced an immutable ledger that changes how the cancellation of accounting entries works. Learn more here.

To access the Journal Entry list, go to:

`Home > Accounting > General Ledger > Journal Entry`
