# Freeze Accounting Entries

In ERPZ, you can freeze accounting entries up to a certain date to prevent users from making changes before that date. Follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Navigate to Accounts Settings

Go to:

`Accounting > Accounting Masters > Accounts Settings`


## Step 2: Set the Frozen Date

In the **Accounts Frozen Upto** field, set the date up to which you want to freeze the accounting entries.

### Books Closed Through

Once this date is set, the system will prevent the creation of any accounting entries before the specified date. If someone tries to create entries for a frozen period, they will receive an error message similar to the following:

### Frozen Date Error

> *"You cannot create accounting entries before the frozen date."*

## 3. Allow Specific Roles to Bypass the Freeze

You can still allow users with certain roles to create or edit entries within the frozen date period. To do this, set the role that has permission in the **Accounts Settings**:

### Role Allowed To Close Books

Specify the role that is allowed to make changes to frozen accounting periods.
