`Accounting > Accounting Masters > Accounts Settings`

Check the **Enable Discount Accounting** box to allow posting of discount entries.

## 2. Default Discount Account

You can also set a **Default Discount Account** for an item, which will be fetched automatically when creating an invoice. The visibility of this field depends on whether **Discount Accounting** is enabled in the **Accounts Settings**.

### Steps to Set a Default Discount Account:

1. Open the **Item** document.
2. Go to the **Item Defaults** table in the **Sales, Purchase, and Accounting Defaults** section.
3. Expand the row of your choice and enter the **Default Discount Account**.
