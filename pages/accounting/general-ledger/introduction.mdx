## General Ledger

The **General Ledger** module in ERPZ serves as a crucial tool for organising, recording, and managing all financial transactions within an organisation. It offers a comprehensive set of features to maintain accurate and up-to-date financial records, ensuring that financial reporting is always transparent and reliable.

### Key Features of General Ledger:

### 1. Journal Entry Template
The **Journal Entry Template** feature allows users to predefine common journal entry formats, making the process of entering routine financial transactions more efficient and less prone to errors.

### 2. Journal Entry
The **Journal Entry** module is where all financial transactions are recorded, capturing both debits and credits, and ensuring the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains balanced. Users can create, modify, and manage journal entries as needed.

### 3. Accounting Entries
All financial transactions in ERPZ generate corresponding **Accounting Entries**, which are automatically reflected in the general ledger. This ensures real-time updates and accurate tracking of financial activities across the organisation.

### 4. Freeze Accounting Entries
The **Freeze Accounting Entries** functionality allows organisations to lock financial transactions after a certain period, preventing further edits. This is useful for maintaining the integrity of financial data after it has been closed for auditing or reporting.

### 5. General Ledger View
The **General Ledger View** provides a detailed overview of all recorded financial transactions. Users can filter data by date, account, or transaction type and drill down into individual entries to gain further insights into the organisation’s financial activities.

### 6. Supplier Ledger Summary
The **Supplier Ledger Summary** offers a consolidated view of all transactions related to suppliers, including payments, outstanding balances, and other relevant financial details. This helps in maintaining an accurate record of payables and supplier relationships.

### 7. Customer Ledger Summary
The **Customer Ledger Summary** displays all transactions involving customers, including invoices, payments, and outstanding amounts. This functionality helps organisations manage receivables and monitor customer account balances effectively.

### 8. Discount Accounting
ERPZ supports **Discount Accounting** to track discounts provided to customers or received from suppliers. By recording these discounts accurately, organisations can ensure that financial records reflect the true cost and revenue of transactions.

### 9. Immutable Ledger
The **Immutable Ledger** feature in ERPZ ensures that once certain financial transactions or periods are closed, they cannot be altered. This feature is particularly important for maintaining compliance with auditing standards and safeguarding the integrity of the organisation’s financial records.
