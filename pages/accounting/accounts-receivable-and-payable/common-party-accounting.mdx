## Common Party Accounting

**Common Party Accounting** in ERPZ enables users to manage unusual transactions, such as creating a Sales Invoice against a primary Supplier. This functionality allows for the adjustment of Sales Invoices against previous purchases from the same supplier.

### Use Case Example

Assume an ERPZ user who has been making Purchase Invoices against a Supplier wishes to create a Sales Invoice against the same supplier and adjust this Sales Invoice against one of their previous purchases.

### 1. Steps to Enable Common Party Accounting

1. **Enable Common Party Accounting**:
   - Navigate to **Accounts Settings**.
   - Enable the **Common Party Accounting** feature.

2. **Create a Link Between Two Parties**:
   - If the primary role of the party is **Supplier**:
     - Go to the **Supplier Master**.
     - Click on **Actions > Link with Customer**.
   - If the primary role of the party is **Customer**:
     - Go to the **Customer Master**.
     - Click on **Actions > Link with Supplier**.

3. **Create a Sales Invoice**:
   - Create a **Sales Invoice** against the Customer that was set as the Secondary Party in the previous step.
   - Upon submitting the Sales Invoice, a Journal Entry will be automatically posted, creating an advance balance against the linked Supplier.

### 2. Reconcile with Purchase Invoice

Now, this Journal Entry advance can be used to reconcile against a Purchase Invoice. This process simplifies the accounting for unusual transactions while maintaining accurate financial records.
