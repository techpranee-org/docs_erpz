# Payment Entry

A Payment Entry is a record indicating that payment has been made for an invoice.

Payment Entry can be made against the following transactions:

- Sales Invoice
- Purchase Invoice
- Sales Order (Advance Payment)
- Purchase Order (Advance Payment)
- Expense Claim
- Internal Transfer

In ERPZ, there are two options through which the user can capture the payment:

- Payment Entry (Default)
- Journal Entry

## Diagrams

Here are diagrams to understand the flow:

- In Sales: Payment Sales
- In Purchase: Payment Purchase

## Accessing Payment Entry

To access the Payment Entry list, go to:

`Home > Accounting > Accounts Receivable/Payable > Payment Entry`

## 1. Prerequisites

A Payment Entry can also be created directly and then linked to an order/invoice later. Before creating and using Payment Entry, it is advised to create the following first:

- Customer
- Supplier
- Bank Account

If you're following the Sales/Purchase Cycle, you'd need the following:

- Sales Order (Advance Payment)
- Purchase Order (Advance Payment)
- Sales Invoice
- Purchase Invoice

**Set up:**

- Chart Of Accounts
- Company (for default accounts)

## 2. How to Create a Payment Entry

On submitting a document against which Payment Entry can be made, you will find the Payment option under the Create button.

### Payment Entry from Sales Invoice

- Change the posting date.
- The Payment Type will be set based on the transaction you're coming from. The types are 'Receive', 'Pay', and 'Internal Transfer'.
- The Party Type, Party, Party Name will be fetched automatically.
- The Account Paid To and Account Paid From will be fetched as set in the Company form.
- The Amount Paid will be fetched from the Invoice.
- Save and Submit.

### Payment Entry from Sales Order

#### 2.1 Creating a Payment Manually

A Payment Entry created manually will have no order/invoice linked to it. Payments made this way will be recorded in the Customer's/Supplier's account and can be reconciled later using the Payment Reconciliation Tool.

1. Go to the Payment Entry list and click on New.
2. Select the Party Type and the respective Customer/Supplier.
3. Select the Bank Account/Cash Account Paid To and Paid From. Enter the Cheque Number and date if bank transfer.
4. Enter the Amount Paid.
5. Save and Submit.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Setting Mode of Payment

**Mode of Payment:** Entering this helps classify Payment Entries based on the payment mode used. Modes of Payment can be Bank, Cash, Wire Transfer, etc.

**Tip:** In the Mode of Payment master, a default Account can be set. This default payment Account will be fetched into Payment Entries.

### 3.2 Payment From/To

- **Payment Party**
  - Party Type: Whether Customer, Supplier, Employee, Shareholder, Student, or NGO Member.
  - Party: The specific party for which the Payment Entry is made.
  - Party Name: The name of the party, this is fetched automatically.
  - Company Bank Account: Your Company's Bank Account.
  - Party Bank Account: The Party's Bank Account.
  - Contact: If the Party is an organization, a Contact person can be stored here.

### 3.3 Accounts

- **Payment Accounts**
  - Party Balance: The overall amount receivable or payable from Customer or Supplier from Invoices set in the current Payment Entry. Paid amounts will be positive, and if advance payments are made, they will be negative.
  - Account Paid From: The Account from which the amount will be deducted when Payment is submitted.
  - Account Paid To: The CoA account from which the amount will be added when Payment Entry is submitted.
  - Account Currency: The Currencies of these accounts will be fetched as set in the Account and cannot be edited here. To know more about transactions in multiple currencies, visit this page.
  - Account Balance: The total amount balance from all the invoices of the selected accounts.
  - Paid Amount: The total amount paid for the current Payment Entry is shown in this field.

**Note:** When making Payment Entries, the default bank account will be fetched in the following order if set:

1. Company form
2. Mode of Payment default account
3. Customer/Supplier default bank account
4. Select manually in Payment Entry

### 3.4 Reference

**Fetching Outstanding Invoices:** This can be used to make payments to multiple Sales Invoices using one Payment Entry. When creating a new Payment Entry, by clicking the Get Outstanding Invoices button or the Get Outstanding Orders button, all the outstanding Invoices and open Orders respectively will be fetched for the party. You need to enter the 'Paid Amount' to see this button. From here, a date range and invoices to be fetched can be selected.

- If the Party has not made full payment, enter the amount paid in the 'Allocated' field.
- If creating Payment Entry for a Customer, the Payment Amount will be allocated against a Sales Invoice. Similarly, when creating Payment Entry for a Supplier, Payment Amount will be allocated against a Purchase Invoice.

**Payment References table:**

- Type: Whether the payment is being made against a Sales Order, Sales Invoice, or a Journal Entry.
- Name: The particular transaction ID is fetched/selected here.
- Total Amount: The total amount of one Invoice/Journal Entry in the row.
- Outstanding: The amount to receive/to pay for this invoice.
- Allocated: If the Paid Amount is less than the invoice amount, only the paid amount will be allocated to the invoice(s) fetched in the Payment Entry. The payment may be made in parts; for example, if there are three invoices of amounts 20, 20, 20, and the Paid Amount is 60, then this Paid Amount will be distributed equally. Payment Terms may also be involved.

### What is Unallocated Amount?

When a Payment Entry is made in ERPZ and the Paid Amount is more than the total invoice amount, it is stored in the Customer's/Supplier's account. This amount is hence currently 'Unallocated.' Unallocated amounts can be used against future invoices.

For example, you create a Sales Invoice totaling 1,000, and the Customer paid 1,500. When another invoice is created for this Customer in the future for 1,000 again, the previously paid 500 can be used.

### 3.5 Deductions or Loss

When a Payment Entry is created against an invoice, there could be some difference in the actual Paid Amount and the invoice outstanding amount. This difference could be due to rounding errors or changes in the currency exchange rate. You can set an Account here where this difference amount will be booked.

The loss/deductions can be written off. For example, if the paid amount is 25 but the allocated amount is 30 since 30 is the amount to be collected as per the invoice, the 'Difference Amount' will be 5 in this case. This difference amount can occur due to discounts or Currency Exchange. The Difference Amount needs to be 0 in order to submit the Payment Entry. This can be adjusted using the Make Difference Entry button. The amount will be adjusted in the Write Off account.

### Writing Off

Write off happens when the paid amount is less than the allocated amount. I.e., the remaining amount is considered as lost in miscellaneous charges or that amount isn't going to be paid. This is considered a loss.

### 3.6 After Submitting

Save and Submit Payment Entry. On submission, outstanding will be updated in the Invoices.

**Invoice Status Updated To Paid**

If a payment entry was created against a Sales Order or Purchase Order, the field 'Advance Paid' will be updated in them. When creating an Invoice against those transactions, Payment Entry will be auto-updated in that Invoice so that you can allocate the invoice amount against the advance payment entry.

For incoming payment, the accounts posting will be done as follows:

- Debit: Bank or Cash Account
- Credit: Customer (Debtor)

For outgoing payment:

- Debit: Supplier (Creditor)
- Credit: Bank or Cash Account

## 4. Other Cases

### 4.1 Multi-Currency Payment Entry

If you want to maintain a receivable/payable account in foreign currency, then create accounts with foreign currency (different from Company currency) and link it in the party account. For example:

**Non-standard Currency in Receivable in Customer**

ERPZ allows you to maintain accounts and invoicing in multiple currencies. If an invoice is made in the party currency, the Currency Exchange Rate between the Company's base currency and party currency is also entered in the invoice.

**Note:** A separate Debtor/Creditor account needs to be created and selected in the Sales Invoice/Order for currency exchange to work correctly. For example, if the Customer is from the US, create a receivable account called 'Debtors US'.

When creating a Payment Entry against that invoice, the current exchange rate will be fetched, but you can set the Currency Exchange Rate at the time of payment to match your records.

Click on the Set Exchange Gain/Loss button to automatically add a row to write off the difference amount.

### 4.2 Internal Transfer

Internal Transfer is used in cases where the money is transferred between the same Company's accounts. For example, if a customer from the US is using PayPal, transferring money from PayPal to a bank account can be considered an Internal Transfer.

Following internal transfers can be managed from the Payment Entry:

- Bank - Cash
- Bank - Bank
- Cash - Cash
- Cash - Bank

## 5. Reporting

Payment Entries can be viewed in reports in Accounting > Payment Entry. You can filter them based on different parameters like Date, Payment Type, Party Type, Party, etc. You can also customize the reports for your specific needs.
