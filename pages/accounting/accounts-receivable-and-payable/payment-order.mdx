# Payment Order

A Payment Order is an internal document used to record bulk payments against Suppliers.

In large corporations, the decision to make payments to Suppliers is typically made by a Purchase Manager, while the action of processing those payments is executed by an Accountant (Accounts User). The Payment Order serves as the communication between the Purchase Manager and the Accountant, notifying the latter to proceed with the payment.

In ERPZ, you can use the Payment Order to fetch multiple Payment Requests created against a Supplier.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and using the Payment Order, it is advisable to create the following first:

- **Purchase Order**
- **Purchase Invoice**

## 2. How to Create a Payment Order

1. Go to the **Payment Order** list and click on **New**.
2. Select the **Company bank account**.
3. Click on the **Get from** button and select **Payment Request**. Apply filters if needed and select the Payment Requests.
