# Debit Note

A Debit Note is a document sent by a buyer to the supplier notifying that a debit has been recorded against the goods returned to the supplier. It serves as a notification of the return of goods and is crucial for maintaining accurate financial records.

## Key Points
- A Debit Note is issued for the value of the goods returned.
- In some cases, sellers may send Debit Notes that should be treated like another invoice.
- A Debit Note serves as a record of the debit against the items being returned.

## 1. How to Create a Debit Note 

You can create a Debit Note against a Purchase Invoice or directly from the Purchase Invoice without reference.

### Steps to Create a Debit Note:
1. Go to the respective **Purchase Invoice**.
2. Click on **Create > Return / Debit Note**. 
   - This will fetch the supplier and item details as set in the Purchase Invoice.
3. If you have paid partially or fully, make a **Payment Entry** against the original Purchase Invoice.
4. Save and Submit the Debit Note.

### Note:
The other steps are similar to creating a Purchase Invoice.

## 1.1 How Does a Debit Note Affect Ledger?
- The Debit Note will reverse the impact of the Purchase Invoice, reflecting the return of goods.

### Debit Note Ledger:
Refer to the Purchase Invoice page for any other details regarding ledger impact.

## 1.2 No Payment Made Against Sales Invoice
If no payment was made against the original invoice, you can cancel the Sales Invoice. However, if only a portion of the items is being returned (e.g., 5 out of 10 items), creating a Debit Note is useful for updating the ledger.

## 2. Example 
Suppose you purchased cotton worth Rs 2400 + taxes from the supplier Blue Mills. Upon delivery, you found that the products were damaged. In this case, you would issue a Debit Note to reflect the return of the damaged goods.

### Creating Debit Note Example:
- **Debit Note with Payment Entry** for the above example will follow the same steps outlined previously.
