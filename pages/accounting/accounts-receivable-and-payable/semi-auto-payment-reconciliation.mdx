# Semi-Auto Payment Reconciliation

If you have a large number of invoices that need to be reconciled quickly without manual allocation, the **Process Payment Reconciliation** doctype can be utilized to streamline the process.

## Steps to Enable and Use Semi-Auto Payment Reconciliation

### 1. Enable Auto Reconcile Payments

First, this feature must be enabled in the Accounts Settings:

- Navigate to **Accounts Settings**.
- Enable the **Auto Reconcile Payments** option.

### 2. Create a Process Payment Reconciliation Document

1. Navigate to the **Process Payment Reconciliation** doctype.
2. Select the **Company**, **Party**, and **Receivable/Payable Account** for which reconciliation is to be done.
3. Save and submit the document. The status will be set to **Queued**.

### 3. Background Job for Reconciliation

A background job runs every 15 minutes to pick up queued documents and initiate reconciliation. If needed, you can also trigger the job immediately by using the **Start / Resume** button.

This action will create a **Process Payment Reconciliation Log** record that details the total number of allocations that will be processed and the successfully reconciled entries.
