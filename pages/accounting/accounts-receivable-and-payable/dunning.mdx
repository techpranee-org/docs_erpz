# Dunning

A Dunning is a document used to send persistent demands for debt payment against an unpaid Sales Invoice.

To access the Dunning list, navigate to:

`Home > Accounting > Dunning`

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Sales Invoice:** A Dunning can only be created against an overdue Sales Invoice.

- **Dunning Type:** A Dunning Type is utilized to pre-fill interest, fees, and text blocks in a new Dunning.

## 2. How to Create a Dunning

You can create a Dunning in two different ways:

### a) Create a New Dunning

1. Go to the Dunning list and click on **Add Dunning**.
2. Select a Customer and click **Fetch Overdue Payments**. This will display a list of overdue Sales Invoices for this customer.
3. Select the invoices you would like to include in this Dunning and click on **Get Items**.

### b) Create a Dunning from an Overdue Sales Invoice

1. Go to the Sales Invoice list and open any overdue Sales Invoice.
2. Click on **Create > Dunning**. This will fetch all overdue payments from the invoice's payment schedule table into a new Dunning.
3. Fill in the remaining fields. 
   - Select a Dunning Type to automatically fill interest, dunning fees, and text blocks with predetermined values, or set these values manually.
   - You can also set an Income Account (e.g., "Other interest and similar income") and Cost Center for the income generated from interest and dunning fees. These will be utilized once a Payment Entry is created from this Dunning.

4. Save and submit the Dunning before sending it to the Customer.

**Dunning Example:**

## 2.1 What is a Dunning Type

A Dunning Type stores default values for dunning fees, interest rates, and text blocks to be included. For instance, a Dunning Type "First Notice" will not have any fees, while a Dunning Type "Second Notice" will include a dunning fee and interest charged on the outstanding amount.

**Dunning Type:**

## 2.2 Statuses

The following statuses are automatically assigned to Dunning:

- **Draft:** A draft is saved but not yet submitted.
- **Unresolved:** The Dunning is marked as unresolved when submitted but no payments have been received.
- **Resolved:** The Dunning is resolved when the outstanding payment has been received.
- **Cancelled:** A Dunning document that has been cancelled.

## 3. Payment

When you receive full payment, including interest and fees, open the unresolved Dunning and click on **Create > Payment**. This action will create a Payment Entry against the outstanding scheduled payments and record the interest and fees as "Payment Deductions or Loss". The Payment Entry will automatically update the Dunning's status to resolved.
