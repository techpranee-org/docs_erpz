# Purchase Invoice

A Purchase Invoice is a bill you receive from your Suppliers against which you need to make the payment.

Purchase Invoice is the exact opposite of your Sales Invoice. Here you accrue expenses to your Supplier. Making a Purchase Invoice is very similar to making a Purchase Order.

To access the Purchase Invoice list, go to:

`Home > Accounting > Accounts Payable > Purchase Invoice`

Before creating and using a Purchase Invoice, it is advised to create the following first:
