## Payment Request

A **Payment Request** is used to request payment from a Customer for a Sales Order or Invoice. Payment Requests can be sent via email and will contain a link to a Payment Gateway if set up. You can create a Payment Request from a Sales Order or a Sales Invoice. Additionally, Payment Requests can be set up against Purchase Orders or Purchase Invoices for internal records. Payments can then be processed in bulk using a Payment Order.

### Accessing Payment Requests

To access Payment Requests, go to:

`Home > Accounting > Accounts Receivable > Payment Request`

### 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and using a Payment Request, it is advisable to create the following first:

- Sales Invoice
- Purchase Invoice
- Sales Order
- Purchase Order

A Payment Request cannot be created manually; it is created from a Sales/Purchase Order or Invoice.

#### 2.1 Creating Payment Request via Sales Order

- Select the appropriate **Payment Gateway Account** on the Payment Request for accounts posting. The account head specified on the payment gateway will be used to create a Journal Entry.

**Note**: The invoice/order currency and the 'Payment Gateway Account' currency should match.

#### 2.3 Notifying the Customer

You can notify the customer from the Payment Request using a Print Format. If the customerâ€™s contact email is set, it will be fetched automatically. Otherwise, you can specify an email address in the Payment Request.

#### 2.5 Payment Request Without Using Any Gateway

If you prefer not to use any integration or payment gateway and only want to send a notification, simply set the **Bank Account**. You will need to compose the message accordingly with bank details. The customer can then transfer the amount to the specified bank account.
