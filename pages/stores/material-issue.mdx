# Material Issue in ERPZ

The **Material Issue** entry in ERPZ is used to manage the issuance of items from a warehouse. When a material issue is submitted, the stock of the specified items is automatically deducted from the source warehouse inventory.

## 1. Common Uses for Material Issue
- **Low-Value Consumables**: Material Issues are commonly used for low-cost consumable items like office supplies, production consumables, or maintenance materials.
- **Stock Reconciliation**: Material Issue entries can also be created to adjust stock levels for serialized or batched items, ensuring accurate stock tracking and reporting.

By using Material Issues, ERPZ helps businesses efficiently manage the flow and availability of consumable items, maintain accurate stock records, and streamline inventory reconciliation.
