# Unit of Measure (UoM)

**A Unit of Measure (UoM)** is a standardized unit used to quantify an item in ERPZ. It defines how an item is measured in inventory, sales, and purchasing transactions.

By default, ERPZ provides a list of common UoMs, but you can add more UoMs based on your specific business needs.

## 1. Different Types of UoMs

Understanding the different units of measure (UoM) is essential for managing inventory accurately. Below are descriptions for each UoM available in ERPZ:

### 1.1 Piece
A **Piece** represents a single unit of an item. This UoM is used for items counted individually, such as electronics, tools, or packaged goods.

### 1.2 Square Inch
**Square Inch** (in²) measures a small area, commonly used for compact items or dimensions, like small tiles, fabrics, or printed materials.

### 1.3 Square Foot
**Square Foot** (ft²) measures area and is often used for moderate-sized spaces, such as flooring, room dimensions, or garden spaces.

### 1.4 Square Yard
**Square Yard** (yd²) is another area measure, primarily used in applications like carpeting, fabric lengths, or larger surfaces in construction.

### 1.5 Square Mile
**Square Mile** (mi²) is a large-scale measurement for expansive land areas. This UoM is typically used for large geographic areas, such as parks, farms, or regions.

### 1.6 Acre
An **Acre** is commonly used to measure land area, especially in agriculture and real estate. One acre equals 43,560 square feet.

### 1.7 Square Centimeter
**Square Centimeter** (cm²) is a small unit of area measurement for precise, compact spaces, often used in engineering or for small components.

### 1.8 Square Meter
**Square Meter** (m²) is a metric unit for medium to large spaces, suitable for room dimensions, building floors, or manufacturing spaces.

### 1.9 Square Kilometer
**Square Kilometer** (km²) is a large unit of area measurement. It’s commonly used to describe large land areas, such as cities, forests, or natural reserves.

### 1.10 Hectare
A **Hectare** is equivalent to 10,000 square meters and is widely used in agriculture, forestry, and land management. It’s a preferred metric for measuring agricultural fields and large plots of land.
