# Warehouses

**A warehouse is a commercial building used for the storage of goods.** Warehouses are essential in industries such as manufacturing, importing, exporting, wholesale, transportation, and customs.

They are typically large, plain buildings located in industrial areas of cities, towns, or villages. These warehouses often have loading docks to facilitate the loading and unloading of goods from trucks.

In ERPZ, the concept of **Warehouse** extends beyond traditional storage spaces and can also represent various storage locations within your organization. You can create sub-Warehouses to represent more granular storage locations, such as a shelf within a larger room.

This structure can form a hierarchical tree like the following:

>*Warehouse > Zone > Aisle > Rack > Shelf > Bin*

#### 3.4 Warehouse Type

    When creating a warehouse in ERPZ, you can select from several different types based on the function and location of the warehouse. Below is a brief description of each warehouse type to help you make the right selection:

    ![Select Warehouse Type from Dropdown](/images/docs/stores/warehouses/warehouseType.png) 

    
- **Plant Warehouse**:  
  A plant warehouse is typically located within or adjacent to a manufacturing facility. It is used to store raw materials, work-in-progress goods, and finished products. This type of warehouse supports production and ensures smooth operations within the plant.

- **Regional Warehouse**:  
  A regional warehouse is positioned to serve a specific geographical area. It helps streamline distribution by storing goods closer to customers in that region, reducing delivery times and shipping costs.

- **Central Warehouse**:  
  A central warehouse acts as the main hub for storage and distribution within an organization. It typically holds larger quantities of goods and supplies products to smaller, regional, or local warehouses.

- **Field Warehouse**:  
  A field warehouse is located near or at a customer or project site. It holds specific inventory to support ongoing work in the field, ensuring that required goods are readily available where they are needed.

- **Transit Warehouse**:  
  A transit warehouse is a temporary storage facility used when goods are in transit between locations. It helps organize and hold products during the shipping process, preventing bottlenecks and ensuring smooth logistics.

- **Bonded Warehouse**:  
  A bonded warehouse is a secure storage facility for goods that are awaiting customs clearance. Goods stored in a bonded warehouse are usually imported items that have not yet been cleared for domestic distribution, allowing for deferred payment of import duties.

These types of warehouses serve different purposes depending on your operational needs. Choose the type that best fits the warehouse's role within your supply chain.

#### 3.5 Address  

When creating a warehouse in ERPZ, you can assign an address by using the search bar or creating a new address via the map feature. Follow these steps to select or create an address:
