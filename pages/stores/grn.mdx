# Goods Receipt Note (GRN) in ERPZ

A **Goods Receipt Note (GRN)** in ERPZ is a document used to confirm the receipt of goods from a supplier. It records details about items received, quantities, and the condition of goods, making it an essential part of inventory and procurement management.

## 1. Purpose of GRN

- **Verification of Goods Received**: The GRN serves as an official acknowledgment that ordered goods have been received. It helps verify that the items match the purchase order in terms of type, quantity, and quality.

- **Inventory Management**: By recording incoming items, the GRN updates stock levels in ERPZ. This enables accurate tracking of inventory and helps prevent stock discrepancies.

- **Financial Control**: The GRN provides a reference for the accounts payable team to match against supplier invoices. This ensures that payments are only made for goods that have been received and are in good condition.

- **Audit and Accountability**: GRNs act as documented proof of goods received, which can be useful for audits and inventory reconciliation. It holds suppliers accountable for delivering goods as per the order specifications.

The GRN process in ERPZ helps organizations maintain transparency, improve inventory accuracy, and ensure effective control over procurement activities.
