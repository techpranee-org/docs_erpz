## 1. Stock Management in ERPZ

In ERPZ, stock management is streamlined through automatic updates and efficient tracking of stock levels. The system is designed to create stock records automatically when a stock audit is performed against a warehouse. Here’s a brief overview of how stock levels are managed and monitored in ERPZ.

## 2. Viewing Available Stock

To view the available stock of a product:
1. Navigate to the **Stores** section from the ERPZ dashboard.
2. Click on **Stock** to display a list of current product stocks.

The stock list provides detailed information for each product, including:
- **Product Name**: Name of the product.
- **Warehouse**: Location where the stock is stored.
- **In Hand**: Current stock level (automatically updated based on stock movements).
- **Min Level** / **Max Level**: Minimum and maximum stock levels for managing inventory.
- **Reorder Level**: The level at which new stock needs to be ordered.
- **Avg Lead Time (Days)**: Average time required to replenish the stock from suppliers.
- **Daily Qty**: Daily quantity requirement.
- **Inward Reserve**: Reserved quantity for future inward stock.
- **Outward Reserve**: Reserved quantity for future outward stock.
- **UOM**: Unit of Measurement for the product.
- **Approval Status**: Indicates if the stock level is approved.
- **Shelf Life (Days)**: Indicates the expiry period of the product.
- **Alerts**: Stock alerts (e.g., Low Stock, Out of Stock, Excess Stock, Near Expiry).

## 3. Editing Stock Information

To edit existing stock data:
1. Click on the **three vertical dots** at the end of the product row.
2. Select **Edit** to open a form containing the product’s details.

Some fields, such as **Product**, **Warehouse**, and **In Hand**, cannot be edited manually. The **In Hand** field is dynamically calculated based on the inward and outward reserves:
- When a **purchase request** is completed, the **Inward Reserve** updates, and the **In Hand** value adjusts accordingly.
- When a **material issue** is completed, the **Outward Reserve** updates, again adjusting the **In Hand** stock level.

## 4. Key Fields in Stock Management

- **Min Level / Max Level**: These values define the acceptable range of stock levels for a product, helping to prevent overstocking or stockouts.
- **Reorder Level**: A threshold level to trigger restocking, ensuring sufficient stock levels to meet demand.
- **Shelf Life (Days)**: This field ensures that products are tracked for expiry, useful for managing perishable goods.
- **UOM (Unit of Measurement)**: Provides standardized units for stock management (e.g., pieces, kilograms).
- **Alerts**: Configurable stock alerts to notify when stock reaches critical levels or approaches expiry, enhancing proactive inventory management.

## 5. Automatic Stock Updates

The ERPZ system automates stock adjustments based on completed purchase requests (inward reserve) and material issues (outward reserve). This dynamic calculation helps keep stock levels accurate in real-time, reducing manual intervention and minimizing stock discrepancies.

By leveraging these stock management tools, ERPZ enables businesses to maintain efficient inventory control, streamline restocking, and avoid stock-related risks, ultimately supporting smoother operations and customer satisfaction.

## 6. Conclusion

Effective stock management is essential for maintaining smooth operations and meeting customer demands. In ERPZ, the automated stock tracking system minimizes manual intervention by dynamically updating stock levels based on inward and outward reserves. This approach ensures real-time accuracy, reducing the risk of stockouts or overstocking. With customizable alerts and detailed fields like reorder level, lead time, and shelf life, ERPZ empowers businesses to make informed inventory decisions, maintain optimal stock levels, and proactively manage supply chain demands. Overall, ERPZ’s stock management tools play a critical role in driving efficiency and supporting strategic growth.
