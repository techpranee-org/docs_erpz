# Purchase Request in ERPZ

A **Purchase Request** in ERPZ is a formal document created to initiate the procurement process for goods or services. This document helps departments or teams within an organization communicate their purchasing needs to the procurement team. It allows for the tracking and approval of procurement requests to ensure that purchasing aligns with the organizationâ€™s requirements and budget.

## 1. Purpose of a Purchase Request
- **Identify and Communicate Needs**: A Purchase Request is used to specify items, quantities, and desired delivery timelines, ensuring clarity in procurement needs.
- **Approval Process**: Purchase Requests often go through an approval workflow to verify the necessity and budget availability before proceeding with procurement.
- **Planning and Budgeting**: By consolidating and approving requests, organizations can manage their inventory levels, budget efficiently, and prevent overstocking or shortages.

## 2. Key Elements of a Purchase Request
- **Requested Items**: Details of items or services, including descriptions, quantities, and specifications.
- **Source Information**: Suggested vendors or suppliers, if available.
- **Required Delivery Date**: Timeline for delivery to help in scheduling and stock planning.
- **Cost Estimates**: Approximate costs to ensure the purchase fits within budget constraints.

Using Purchase Requests in ERPZ enhances control over purchasing, streamlines the approval process, and improves transparency and accountability in procurement activities.
