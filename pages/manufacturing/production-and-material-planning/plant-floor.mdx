# Plant Floor

   - Navigate to **Manufacturing > Plant Floor > New**.
   - Define the plant floor and associate it with the relevant warehouse.

2. **Create Workstations**
   - Establish individual workstations by creating machines and linking them to the plant floor.
   - Assign an illustration for each workstation to indicate its active and inactive statuses.

3. **Monitor Machine Status**
   - After setting up workstations, users can easily view the operational status of machines on the plant floor.
