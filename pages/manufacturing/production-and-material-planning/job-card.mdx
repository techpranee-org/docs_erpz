# Job Card

**A Job Card stores actual production information about a particular operation performed on a particular workstation.**

A Job Card is created from the Work Order and assigned to each of the workstations on the manufacturing floor to initiate the production of an item with a specified quantity for each operation defined in the Work Order.

### Key Features of Job Card

- **Material Requests**: Each Job Card allows the workstation to issue a “Material Request” and “Stock Transfer to Manufacture” for the raw materials required against a Job Card.
- **Production Tracking**: Job Card completion updates the production status in the Work Order, enabling tracking of the completion of production progress for each operation defined in the Work Order.

## 1. Accessing Job Card

To access the Job Card list, navigate to:  
`Home > Manufacturing > Production > Job Card`

## 2. Prerequisites

Before creating and using a Job Card, it is advised that you create the following:

- **Bill of Materials (BOM)**
- **Operation**
- **Workstation**
- **Work Order**

## 3. How to Create a Job Card

A Job Card for operations is automatically created when a Work Order is submitted.

### Steps to Use a Job Card

1. Click on the **Start Job** button, then on **Complete Job** when you're finished.
2. Alternatively, fill in the **From Time** and **To Time** in the Time Logs table.
3. Select the **Employee** to whom the Job Card was assigned.
4. Enter the **Completed Quantity**—the number of items on which the operation was performed during the selected time interval.
5. Add more rows in the Time Logs table and record time using the **Start/Complete** buttons.
6. Click on **Submit**.

In a Work Order, operations and workstations are fetched from the BOM of an item. For ease of use, ensure that the routing is configured in the BOM.

### Job Card Details

- Each Job Card created will have workstation and operations assigned.
- The raw material required from each source warehouse will be calculated based on the quantity needed for production.
- On submitting a Work Order, Job Cards will be auto-created based on the values in the operations table.

### Material Request Against Job Card

A Material Request will be raised from the Job Card to prepare the raw materials required for the manufacturing process. This request will reference the original Job Card number.

## 4. Tracking Manufacturing Progress

Job Card completion enables tracking of manufacturing progress within the Work Order by monitoring the completion of each operation related to the Work Order.

### Scrap Items

During operations, some scrap materials may be produced. Users can add details of scrap items to the Job Card, including defective or broken materials in the scrap items table.

## 5. Features

### Tracking Quality Inspection (Introduced in Version 13)

For production orders, the quality of in-process (semi-finished) goods needs to be tracked. This is defined by the processes (operations) performed on it, which are outlined in the Job Card. In-process tests differ from incoming and outgoing material tests. Monitoring quality during manufacturing ensures that the finished product meets desired quality standards. You can create a Quality Inspection for the production item against the Job Card.
