# Operation

An **Operation** in ERPZ refers to any manufacturing activity or task performed on raw materials as part of the production process. Operations play a critical role in transforming raw materials into finished goods.

The **Operation Master** stores details of each manufacturing operation, including its name, description, and the default workstation where the operation is performed.

## Accessing the Operation List

To access the Operation list in ERPZ, follow this path:

**Home > Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > Operation**

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating and using an Operation in ERPZ, ensure that the following is set up:

- **Workstation**: This defines where the operation will be performed.

## 2. How to Create an Operation

Follow these steps to create a new Operation:

1. **Go to the Operation List**: Navigate to the Operation list by following the path mentioned above, then click on **New**.
2. **Enter Operation Details**:
   - **Operation Name**: Provide a name for the operation (e.g., "Cutting").
   - **Default Workstation**: Select the default workstation where this operation will be performed. This information will automatically be fetched in Bill of Materials (BOM) and Work Orders.
   - **Quality Inspection Template**: In the **Job Card** section, you can select a Quality Inspection Template for this operation. This will be fetched in the Job Card when creating Work Orders. When a new Quality Inspection is generated from the Job Card, the template will be automatically applied.
   - **Description**: Optionally, add a description to explain what the operation entails.
3. **Save**: Once all details are entered, click **Save** to store the operation.

Once saved, the operation can be linked to various manufacturing tasks like BOMs, Work Orders, and Job Cards.

## 3. Related Features

After creating an operation, the following can be associated with it:

- **Routing**: The operation can be added to a routing, which defines the sequence of manufacturing operations for a product.
- **Job Card**: A job card is generated for each operation when a Work Order is created, allowing operators to track the progress of the operation.
