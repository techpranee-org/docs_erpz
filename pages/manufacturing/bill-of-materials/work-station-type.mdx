2. Click on **Add Workstation**.
3. Select the **Workstation Type** from the dropdown.

## 4. Auto-Assigning Jobs Based on Workstation Type

After setting up the Workstation Type:

- When a user creates a **Work Order** with Operations, the system will automatically create **Job Cards** for the Operations.
- The system will then assign the available Workstation based on the **Workstation Type** set in the BOM.

This feature ensures that job assignments are optimized based on Workstation availability and type, reducing manual effort in selecting Workstations.
