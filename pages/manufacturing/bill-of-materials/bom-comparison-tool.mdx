# BOM Comparison Tool

The **BOM Comparison Tool** in ERPZ allows you to compare two different versions of a Bill of Materials (BOM) and see the changes made between them. This tool is useful for tracking alterations in the manufacturing process, ensuring that you understand the differences between BOM iterations.

## Why Use the BOM Comparison Tool?

Over time, a BOM (Bill of Materials) may undergo multiple changes as new components are introduced, or processes are updated. When you amend a BOM, you cancel the previous version and create a new one, which can result in lost change history. The BOM Comparison Tool helps you visually track and compare changes between two BOMs, ensuring that no detail is overlooked.

## 1. How to Use the BOM Comparison Tool

To use the BOM Comparison Tool, follow these steps:

1. Go to `Home > Manufacturing > Tools > BOM Comparison Tool`.
2. In the **BOM 1** field, select the older version of the BOM that you want to compare.
3. In the **BOM 2** field, select the new version of the BOM that you want to see the differences for.

Once both BOMs are selected, the tool will immediately show the differences between the two versions. This comparison can include changes in raw materials, quantities, sub-assemblies, or any other BOM components.

### 1.1 Key Features of the BOM Comparison Tool

- **Side-by-Side Comparison:** View the old and new BOMs side by side to easily spot the differences.
- **Component Changes:** Identify changes in materials, quantities, and sub-assemblies between the two BOMs.
- **Version Tracking:** Ensure that any changes made to the BOM are visible and traceable between different versions.

By using the **BOM Comparison Tool**, manufacturers can maintain transparency and accuracy in their production processes, helping teams ensure that the most up-to-date BOM is being used without losing track of previous iterations.

## 2. Practical Example

Consider a scenario where you updated the BOM for a product to replace a component with a newer version. The BOM Comparison Tool can be used to compare the older BOM with the new one, highlighting the replaced component and any other changes. This ensures that all team members are aware of the updated production requirements.

The BOM Comparison Tool streamlines version management, making it easier to track changes and maintain consistency across different iterations of your BOMs.
