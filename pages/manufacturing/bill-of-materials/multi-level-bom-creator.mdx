# Multi-level BOM Creator

The **BOM Creator** in ERPZ allows users to create multi-level Bills of Materials (BOMs) using a single screen, simplifying the process and reducing the need for multiple steps.

## Why Use the BOM Creator?

Users may wonder why a separate BOM Creator is needed when the standard BOM screen exists. The answer lies in efficiency and ease of use. 

In the standard BOM screen, users must first create the sub-assembly BOMs, and then create the BOM for the final product, which often involves back-and-forth navigation between screens. Visualizing the full BOM hierarchy is also challenging in the standard format.

The **BOM Creator** solves these problems by allowing users to construct a multi-level BOM using a tree structure, making it easier to manage complex manufacturing processes.

## How to Use the BOM Creator

The BOM Creator interface provides a streamlined way to build multi-level BOMs step by step.

### 1. Select the Final Product

Begin by selecting the **Final Product** for which you want to create the multi-level BOM. Once selected, save the record.

### 2. Add Raw Materials and Sub-assembly Items

After saving the Final Product, you can start adding **Raw Materials** and **Sub-assembly** items. The tree component in the BOM Creator allows you to build a hierarchical structure for your multi-level BOM.

### 3. Convert Raw Materials to Sub-assemblies

If you want to convert a raw material into a sub-assembly item, simply select the item and click the *Convert to Sub-Assembly* button.

### 4. Edit Quantities

You can adjust the quantity of each item in the BOM as required for the manufacturing process.

### 5. Submit the BOM

Once the multi-level BOM structure is complete using the tree component, submit the BOM Creator. Upon submission, ERPZ will automatically generate the BOMs using background jobs.
