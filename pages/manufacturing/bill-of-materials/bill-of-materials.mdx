# Bill Of Materials

**A Bill of Materials is a list of items and sub-assemblies with quantities required to manufacture an Item.**

A BOM may also contain the manufacturing operations required to manufacture the Item.

A **Bill of Materials** (BOM) is central to the Manufacturing system and helps create other document types like Work Orders and Job Cards. ERPZ supports multi-level BOMs.

The **BOM** is a list of all materials (either bought or made) and operations that go into manufacturing a finished product or sub-assembly. In ERPZ, each item (sub-assembly) can have its own BOM, forming a tree of Items with multiple levels.

### Work Order

To make accurate Purchase Requests, you must always maintain correct BOMs.

To access the BOM list, go to:

`Home > Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > Bill of Materials`

Once a BOM is submitted, it cannot be edited. You can only cancel the existing, duplicate it, and submit another one. Since a BOM is linked to multiple places in the Manufacturing module, changing it can be time-consuming. It's a good practice to carefully think and fill out the BOMs before submitting.

## 1. Prerequisites
Before creating and using a BOM, it is recommended that you create the following first:

- Item
- Operation
- Workstation
- Routing

## 2. How to create a Bill of Materials

1. Go to the Bill of Materials list, click on **New**.
2. Select the Item to be manufactured. The Item name, UoM, company, and currency will be fetched automatically.
3. Enter the quantity of the Item that will be manufactured from this Bill of Materials.
4. Under the **Items** table, select the raw materials (Items) required to manufacture the Item. Then proceed to:

   - Select the quantity of Raw Material used.
   - Set an Item operation to be fetched in Work Orders later.
   - If this Item is a sub-assembly, the default BOM for it will be fetched.
   - Select the **Source Warehouse** to track inventory.
   - Enter the scrap percentage that will remain after this raw material is used.

   Save and Submit.

5. In the **Items** table, tick the **Include Item in Manufacturing** checkbox for Raw Materials. If there are services or operations to include in the BOM that are not necessarily an Item, uncheck this checkbox. For example, a chemical treatment on plastic that incurs cost but isn’t an Item.

## 2.1 Bill of Materials with Operations

To add Operations, tick the **With Operations** checkbox. Now, an **Operations** table will appear. This option tracks the cost of Operations during manufacturing. Operations can be added by setting a template in the **Routing** master.

In the **Operations** table, add the operations needed to manufacture the Item:

- Select the Workstation where the Operation will be performed.
- Enter the Operating Hourly Rate, Operation Time (in minutes), and the Batch Size produced.
- The Operating Cost will be calculated based on these values.

Materials can be transferred against a Work Order in bulk or through individual Job Cards depending on various factors, such as time to manufacture and the skill level of labor.

## 2.2 Additional options when creating a Bill of Materials

- **Is Active**: Uncheck to disable this BOM if an alternative set of materials/operations is to be used.
- **Is Default**: This BOM will be selected by default in Work Orders when the Item is selected.
- **Inspection Required**: Make **Quality Inspection** mandatory for raw materials and finished goods. Select the Quality Inspection Template after ticking this checkbox.
- **Allow Alternative Item**: This allows alternative items to be used if specific materials are unavailable.
- **Allow Same Item Multiple Times**: Sometimes, the same item needs to be added more than once. This option allows the same item to appear multiple times in the BOM.
- **Set rate of sub-assembly item based on BOM**: Set sub-assembly item rates based on their BOM.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 BOM Costing

The Costing section in a BOM provides an approximate cost of manufacturing the Item. The costing is based on the Valuation Rate of the raw materials/sub-assemblies and the Operation costs. Costs can be updated via the **Update Cost** button.

### 3.2 Materials Required (Exploded)

The **Materials Required (Exploded)** table lists all raw materials required to manufacture an Item, including sub-assemblies. Use the **Do Not Explode** option if you do not wish to explode sub-assembly items.

For example, when manufacturing a laptop, a company might keep the motherboard in stock. To avoid exploding the motherboard’s BOM, use the **Do Not Explode** option.

### 3.3 Project and Website

The BOM can be linked to a Project for tracking progress and costs. It can also be shown on the website for open-source hardware products.

### 3.4 BOM Template

A BOM template allows for the creation of BOMs for template items. The template BOM is used as the default BOM when making Work Orders against a template item’s variants.

### 3.5 After Submitting

Once the BOM is submitted, you can create the following document types against the BOM:

- Work Orders
- Job Cards
