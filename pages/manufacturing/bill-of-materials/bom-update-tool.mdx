# BOM Update Tool

The **BOM Update Tool** in ERPZ allows users to replace a sub-assembly BOM and update the costs of all parent BOMs with ease. This tool is particularly useful when you need to update the BOM of a sub-assembly item that is linked to a larger parent BOM.

## Why Use the BOM Update Tool?

In cases where a sub-assembly undergoes changes—like adding or replacing items—you'll need to update the parent BOMs where that sub-assembly is used. Instead of manually updating each parent BOM, the **BOM Update Tool** streamlines this process by automatically replacing the old BOM with the new one across all relevant parent BOMs.

## 1. How to Use the BOM Update Tool

To access the BOM Update Tool, go to:

`Home > Manufacturing > Tools > BOM Update Tool`

### 1.1 Example Scenario

Let’s take a look at an example to better understand how the tool works.

A company manufactures computers, and the Bill of Materials (BOM) for the computer includes the following components:

- Monitor
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- CPU

The **CPU** is a sub-assembly with its own BOM, which consists of the following items:

- 250 GB Hard Disk
- Motherboard
- Processor
- SMTP
- DVD Player

Now, suppose the company needs to update the CPU's BOM by replacing the **250 GB Hard Disk** with a **950 GB Hard Disk**. Here’s how you can use the BOM Update Tool:

### 1.2 Steps to Update a Sub-assembly BOM

1. Create the new BOM for the CPU, reflecting the updated parts (in this case, replacing the hard disk).
   
   **New CPU BOM:**
   - 950 GB Hard Disk
   - Motherboard
   - Processor
   - SMTP
   - DVD Player

2. Open the **BOM Update Tool**.
   
3. Select the current BOM of the sub-assembly (CPU) and the new BOM you’ve created.

4. Click the **Replace** button to update the parent BOM (Computer). The system will automatically replace the old CPU BOM with the new one in all parent BOMs where the CPU is used.

### 1.3 Will the BOM Replace Tool Work for Replacing Exploded Items?

No, exploded items without their own BOMs cannot be replaced using this tool. For instance, if the **Monitor** does not have a sub-assembly and needs updating, you cannot use the BOM Update Tool. In such cases, you should either cancel and amend the current BOM or create a new BOM for the finished item.

## 2. Update BOM Cost

In addition to replacing sub-assemblies, you can also update the costs of all BOMs based on the latest prices. This can be done using the **Update latest price in all BOMs** button.

- The system will automatically update the BOM costs based on the most recent purchase price, price list rate, or valuation rate of raw materials.
- This process is performed in the background, as it may take several minutes depending on the number of BOMs in your system.

### 2.1 Automating BOM Cost Updates

You can set the system to update BOM costs automatically on a daily basis. To enable this, go to:

**Home > Manufacturing > Settings > Update BOM Cost Automatically**

This setting ensures that all BOM costs are kept up-to-date without manual intervention.

By using the **BOM Update Tool**, you can efficiently manage sub-assembly replacements and ensure that BOM costs are always accurate in ERPZ.
